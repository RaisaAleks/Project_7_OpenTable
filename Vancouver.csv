Great food and friendly service - top notch  Great service, friendly staff. Food is great. Love that they have Vegan options!  Brunch was fantastic. Everything fresh and tasty. And the service was excellent, particularly Emma, who displayed the perfect level of attentiveness.  This was my first time trying the restaurant with a friend. We had the fish tacos and the scallops, which were perfect. Our server was very friendly and checked in with us frequently to make sure everything was fine. However, we noticed that she seemed to be rushing us towards the end. While my friend was still eating her food, the server asked a couple of times if she was done, even in the middle of our conversation she would interrupted us  . obvious my friend was still eating, but she felt rushed and eventually asked the server to take the plate and bring the bill. I found this behavior rude and unprofessional . When I asked her if it’s the end of her shift she said yes , she will be done after this. Read more Great food and exceptional service. Our server - Angel was great.  The food and atmosphere at Birdies is great!  Service is top notch!  They really care about the quality of food they serve. My cousin ordered the prosciutto arugula pizza.  It was a little burned on one side.  It wasn’t that bad, but they brought it out so my cousin could eat the side that wasn’t burned while they made her another one.  She said it was delicious. I had the poke bowl which was also good. When it came  time for the bill, they told us they didn’t charge for the pizza.  Wow!  Talk about good customer service!  We were celebrating my cousin’s birthday.

The restaurant was in a fairly nondescript building and the decor was humble so we were expecting to have a perfectly acceptable but not exciting meal, we were very pleasantly surprised. It was a great meal! I won't say ""for the price"" because that implies it was not as good as food we might have paid much more for.

Too noisy inside but on a nice day the location on the drive is the coolest place in Vancouver.  I had made a late reservation for lunch with 2 elders who were about 40 minutes late - and the staff were very welcoming and relaxed about all that. We had a lovely lunch & a good visit and I was grateful because, in their 80s - it is a big deal for them to venture out  - to drive and to park and etc etc. 
The gracious welcome and understanding and the thoughtful service was much appreciated all around.

Then we shared a main course. I always have a good experience at Havana, would recommend this lively place on the Drive  The drinks are the best at Havana! Liam is an incredible manager as well!  He helped move us to a beautiful spot on the patio and he is fantastic with engaging with guests. Great experience!!  Great Food. Wonderful service. Lovely location. Music was a bit loud so that could be lowered a bit.  I love Havana and I go there almost exclusively for the Mussels Espana. On my last visit, they were sub-par. The tasted strong and there was very little chorizo in the dish. The portion size was also smaller. I’m used to them being crazy good with every mouthful and it was so disappointing. I hope it was just an off day.  Good spot to share plates with friends while having a bevy or two.

Service and food was pretty good for casual get togethers.  Nice ambiance,a bit noisy but manageable.

The sauce on the brisket was tasty, but the meat was very chewy... the endive salad was basic and something I could've easily made myself at home. The garlic squid was by far the best plate we had all night.

Can’t score more than 3 and definitely not worth the $$. Not going to go again. Read more Excellent services and wonderful food.  The manager felt one of our items took too long (we did not notice) and was apologetic and comp'd us for the item and our wine.  Much appreciated and excellent extra service without being called for.  Thankyou.  Great night to be sitting near large windows looking out on the city! The service was great, our waitress was very attentive. Food was very good, but I wish my fish and vegees had been hotter.
Lovely space!  Great food, awesome service but the music was way too loud to talk to one another.  Great experience with less food options as it’s bar and cafe  Wonderful brunch and great service.

Having several industry people recommend it to me and seeing them get a Michelin guide nod, I definitely went in with high expectations.  Outstanding dinner, attentive service, great ambiance.  Well done, thank you!  Food was reasonable but money for value was low. Almost $30 for burrata. Another $30 for 5 small pieces of salmon. My main complaint was the noise level. Exceptionally loud and the place had a very echo-y feel so it was challenging to talk and hear. The server was pleasant.  Great dinner, excellent food and vibe. Great tasting cocktails.  Love this place! Been there at least 4 times since it opened. The food, wine and cocktails are all excellent and good value -- meaning not cheap but reasonably priced for the quality, quantity and inventiveness. Favourite dishes are the Tofino King Salmon (dried aged to give it so much flavour), seared scallops, and kale gnocchi. The food here is really interesting. The service is friendly and unpretentious. I hope their Michelin mention does not make it impossible to get a reso now or ruin it like Anna Lena which was also a favourite Kits neighbourhood restaurant then went pretentious and out of reach expense wise. Bravo is a neighbourhood gem. I hope it stays that way! Read more We came here because it was michelin recommended. We ordered the hokkaido scallops, king salmon, shishitos and tagliolini. Our favourite dish was the king salmon which has a nice zesty flavour. Our least favourite was the scallops as it was a bit disappointing. The coconut and tapioca made it taste like an asian dessert rather than an appetizer. The pasta was good but a bit heavy and not really considered a tapas dish. Overall a decent experience and we would give it another try! Read more Amazing all around. Lively room with chill people. Great staff.  Lots of food choices. The mains are pretty filling.

Loved the restaurant and will surely recommend and come back  Absolutely superb food, and cheerful friendly service. Also very noisy - we were shouting at each other in order to be heard at our table. Things got better after about 90 minutes as the restaurant began to clear out.
Our server was great, but when our mains came out (pork chops for one, duck for the other two) we had to ask for appropriate sharp knives to cut meat. We weren’t expecting that in a highly-rated restaurant.

When we told the server, he said the chef renders it completely, which was confusing because the pork belly we had on our gnocchi had a very clear fat section. My mom was pretty upset because she was looking forward to that the most and she said it was not the same as she had it before.

I was also disappointed by the long delays in service.

We did have to seek out a person to resolve 2 small issues which were resolved. Overall I would recommend this restaurant. We did have a bill issue - we asked for a little extra gravy which they charged us for. We told them this was unacceptable and they did take it off. Problem solved.  Happy Thanksgiving. Read more The food was good. It was the right temperature too We liked the service but the restaurant was understaffed and it created some discomfort for my party. We could clearly see they were busy on the floor but at same time we had some trouble getting service to come to our own table. Unfortunately this type of restaurant experience is becoming normal.  That was the best thanksgiving meal of all time. Friendly and top notch staff and incredible food. Turkey was done to perfection and the sides were amazing, from the parsnips to the carrots, brussel sprouts, stuffing and mashed potatoes. The orange cranberry sauce WOW. 
Salad - PERFECT - and the Pumpkin pie was out off this world. It came with a berry compote and the only way I can describe it, was it tasted like Christmas. (My only complaint, for me. It didn’t need the coconut on top). All the flavours went perfect together and the glass of champagne completed the deal. Well worth the price and I had an amazing night, Thanks to everyone working hard and fast to get the job done.
Whoever came up with the compote and pumpkin pie idea, way to go Chef…………..

That, was a memorable occasion for me and I will be talking about it for weeks or more I am sure. See you next year.

Great for business and romantic dinings.  We expected Thanksgiving turkey dinner which was advertised. Disappointing that we were told the turkey and chicken were sold out at 6:30 PM and it took almost an hour and a half to be served.  Impeccable service and high quality food.
Nice room with great atmosphere. 
The veal was sublime. The sea bass excellent. 
Very interesting cocktails and extensive wine list.
We will be back very soon. Read more Our server was outstanding and added to the experience  It was our first time at Tutto Italian Restaurant. The atmosphere in the restaurant is really nice, and the service is also great. We came to this restaurant for the Thanksgiving dinner special. In all honesty, I was rather disappointed with the quality of the food. It was very average for the price. I appreciate that Turkey, stuffing, and brussel sprouts etc is not traditional Italian food. I feel that the restaurant took advantage of the opportunity to sell a basic Thanksgiving dinner at an elevated price. Our server had told us that we would be receiving bone in chicken, as the Turkey had run out. When the food came, it was actually Turkey. Perhaps they still had some left? The Turkey itself was from a Turkey roll. The stuffing was very dry and quite tasteless. The Brussel sprouts were tiny and cut in halves. I think maybe I had three Brussels in total. The potato & prosciutto gratin was quite nice, but also a very small portion. I wish I had taken a photo to show you. To be fair, we did not get the opportunity to try the traditional Italian food so I cannot speak to the quality of the food on the regular menu. I will add that we were charged $12 for the piece of focaccia bread that came to the table. I appreciate that this restaurant is in Yaletown, so there’s likely a premium to pay because of the location. I certainly wouldn’t recommend going there for the Thanksgiving dinner special, but I have read good reviews about their other food so please don’t just make your decision to go, based solely on my review.

We ordered meatballs - they were barely warm, monkey bread cheese was melted but bread was room temperature, calamari was good, Caesar salad was bland and small for the price.  It was like they laid some leaves on a plate and threw a dollop of bottled dressing on it.   Overall not a place I’d return to Read more I had the burger for lunch and it was pretty good! Truffle fries were good too, thick cut and flavourful. Very reasonable price for A quick lunch.  This is my second dining experience at Honey Salt . It was their pasta Sunday menu.  The appetizers were so so - the  calamari was too soft and the Caesar’ s salad was quite bland and not of hotel standard.  The three pasta dishes were fine. The most satisfying dish was their Society Cake which was my main reason to dine there.

The service was reasonable. Ambience could have been better if we were able to dine in their main section but it was closed for an event.

Very pleasant restaurant  with good good and friendly staff  I have gone to honey salt on a few occasions but had a very lacklustre experience here for todays brunch. I felt a bit rushed to initially order as the server asked maybe a minute or 2 following my requesting a menu (I originally received the wrong one- no fault there mistakes happen). After taking my order + delivering my food I never saw my server again. The salt shaker on the table was out + I was hoping to receive a steak knife for my avocado toast as it was really tough to cut with the provided knife. No one checked in and it was not until I was fully done my brunch someone came by. It wad a new server who checked in and took my payment. It felt a bit odd and I didn’t leave feeling great about having chosen to come in. Read more The quality of food and service has gone down terribly.  The pasta Sunday deal was a good deal. But the Elizabeth salad seemed like a side salad with only a few bites. Not much for presentation or many ingredients for the price.  Delicious but quick dinner before a show at the arena.

The service was lovely and a wonderful experience for the holidays.  The food was delicious and the server we had tonight was amazing. We never felt rushed, we never felt dismissed, we had everything we needed. Her friendliness and positive attitude was contagious, and we left better than when we came in. A truly enjoyable experience  Very disappointed.  Our server was fantastic but the food was very disappointing. Thanksgiving dinner - I chose turkey which was super dry and the whole meal looked awful on the plate.   They took it away.   I don’t eat fish so my only other option was ravioli which was luke warm/cold.  My husband had it too and was halfway through before mine arrived.  His ravioli didn’t have much sauce so I had to scoop some of my sauce on to his plate.   The dessert was a tiny slice dry tiramisu. Overall the meal was terrible.

Food is presented beautifully with a wonderful variety and the turkey was absolutely delicious!  I really enjoyed the Notch8 afternoon tea. The whole experience was phenomenal from every aspect. So this time we tried the brunch buffet experience. It was $89 pp and thanksgiving theme. Quite mediocre for the price. All the  dishes were decent and none of which stood out. For a buffet, the selection was limiting.  Service was not as spectacular as the last time, which was only a year ago. And only one washroom stall inside the restaurant for everybody dinning. The alternative was to leave the restaurant and go downstairs of the hotel to utilize those facilities.

The highlight was the ambience. Overall everything else was fine. But I just had a higher expectation for a luxury hotel restaurant. Read more Too much smell coming in from the kitchen. Otherwise, quite pleasant.  Our waitress (sorry I forgot to ask her name) was excellent. So friendly.  Quickly brought us everything we wanted. Huge smile. We wanted a relatively quiet chat with our group. Unfortunately, the table next to us was boisterous. We discreetly requested a table change and was accommodated right away.  One reason I picked Notch8 was because I did not want the usual crowded squeezed tables in many buffets these days.  Notch8 did not squeeze tables in. Price is not cheap, but if you are treating yourself to a convenient location (short walk from Skytrain), nice setting, non-crowded seating, good food, excellent service, Notch8 is worth it.

Nice variety of dishes in small portions like tapa-style. Turkey was juicy and tender.  Horrible. Not on par with other restaurants at Fairmont properties. We were expecting something similar to Botanist at the Fairmont Pacific Rim, however the atmosphere was dated, cheap, worn-out and dingy. Seating in the “lounge” were all tall tables with bar stools, so we elected to sit in the dining room - also zero ambiance and felt like a the standard fair of a cheap hotel restaurant but with the prices of a Fairmont. Several tables were so incredibly loud we could not even hold a conversation at our table - a group of about 15 older women probably should have been seated in a private room as the entire restaurant was filled with their screaming and cackling. Overall a completely miserable experience, and not at all what was expected when one thinks of a lunch at the fairmont. I won’t ever come back to this fairmont. To make things worse our glass were dirty, with little black things floating in the water.

Service was poor from beginning to end. 
Was ignored at the reception desk but multiple employees. 
I had to ask if I could be seated for my reserved time. My dinner guest and I weren’t offered the (free) bubbles, that other guests were given. I questioned this and was told some would be brought to the table: it never arrived. 
Food was placed on our table and we were not asked if we wanted any condiments. I had to call the server back to ask for vinegar. 
My dinner companion ordered steak. No steak knife provided. 
The “grilled chicken club sandwich” was more of a broiled chicken burger. 
I ordered a second glass of wine and mentioned to the server that it tasted very different to the first glass I ordered. The server was indignant that I had suggested that they had brought the wrong drink. 
My dinner companion had their coat and bag on the spare chair at our table and was told that they had to remove it as the chair was needed at a different table.

It was very nice to have the reservation and skip the long walk-in line.
We chose to sit inside instead of on the patio, because while the patio had a great view, it was loud. The inside was actually kind of interesting; they have a big wall of books (mostly older educational books) that we looked at after we ate. Washrooms are single-stall and clean.
Our server was very friendly, although left us alone for a bit too long after we'd finished our entrees and wanted to order dessert, and eventually pay.
The food was good. I got the ranchero rice bowl with tofu, and shared the fall special pumpkin pie bread pudding for dessert. Good flavours in the rice bowl. The cajun tofu was generously seasoned and a little spicy. The pumpkin pie bread pudding was a really unique way to enjoy pumpkin pie, and the tangy labneh centre was a nice touch. I definitely recommend trying this.
One of my friends and I ordered the ube colada to drink. I was going to get the regular version, but when she ordered, she asked for non-alcoholic and I decided to switch to non-alcoholic after I found out they could make it. I thought it was okay but didn't taste much like ube, but she said she could taste the ube. We both found very sweet though; I bet the alcohol helps cut the sweetness in the regular version.

Enjoyed happy hour Read more Server was very personable, the food was delicious and the menu had good variety.  Went here for a pre-concert meal with my husband ahead of the P!NK concert with a reservation for 2 booked for an hour and a half before doors were set to open for the concert (which should have been plenty of time to order, get our food, eat, and pay). Waited an hour for our appetizer and had to cancel the rest of the order because the food was so slow to come out. This was very surprising and disappointing given this location should be very well prepped and staffed for pre-show crowds at Rogers Arena, Queen Elizabeth Theatre and BC Place. The only saving grace was that we weren't charged for the appetizer and drinks after we told them to cancel the rest of the order. Read more It was extremely busy (Pink concert), but our waitress was wonderful and kept up with the crazy pace. Excellent service and food was delicious.  We had a 6 pm reservation as we had a concert to go to at 8 pm. We thought we would be done well in time (by 7:30 or so) to go to the concert! We ordered our food by 6:15 pm and at 7:30 were told that it would be at least 10-15 more minutes to get our food! It looked like no one was getting their food at this point! Our waiter was very kind and didn't charge us for our drinks which was good. Don't plan to go there before a concert unless you give yourself 3 or 4 hours! We will never go there again!

Iris Julio  Always a great night. Thanks for accommodating my changing needs from Business meeting to dinner with a friend afterwards!  Great service!  A very busy restaurant and extremely loud music.  Our food was very good but the gem of the evening was our server, Ada.  She is extremely personable and charming.  Ada was very busy but somehow she found time to talk to all her guest and make them feel right home.  The serving of the food was kinda off. We ordered appetizers and they were brought out plus my friends main dinner which she wasn’t ready for. So they took it back and brought it out later reheated. To get more drinks took a bit to get someone’s attention. Music was way too loud. Everyone had a drink deducted from the bill for the inconvenience except me. Not sure why.

I don’t know why I keep trying restaurants in Gastown. They are always bad. Between the tourists and young clientele who don’t know the difference between good and bad, it always disappoints. We started with guac and chips. The guac was commercial and not fresh. Then ordered shrimp aguachile and a queso dish as appetizers rather than commit to mains. The aguachile was just gross. The tails were still on the shrimp and dumped in a marinade that I’m praying was enough to cook/brine the shrimp. The queso would have been good if it was fully melted, but it wasn’t.

Attentive service, acceptable noise level for a conversation and the dishes were cooked as requested. Keep it up!  Even though we were on the 2nd floor and beside the opening to the ground floor, there was a cupboard that we could hear opening/closing quite often (likely on the ground floor). It was distracting from our conversations and would be good to add noise dampening to the cupboards  The food was excellent. Best bread ever. Only exceeded by our caring and helpful waiter. In fact the entire staff from hostess to waitstaff was exceptional. A lovely evening.  We go to this location often when we're downtown for a concert.  They never disappoint.  Our server Colin was also just great.  Service is comfortable and professional. We had a great dining time.  I was greeted with a smile and promptly seated. Hannah was my server and she was very personable and very good at listening to what I wanted and filling my order promptly.  Our time at this restaurant was absolutely incredible, thanks to the wonderful staff, cozy atmosphere, and, of course, the amazing food. 🍽️✨  We always like their food and service.  This is different location we went. Steaks cooked perfectly the way we want. Waitress was good and attentive. No hesitation to come back again.  Great experience servers were on point. As a Chef I applaud the service staff and the cooks who made our dinner great  This location is great they welcome you warmly at the front entrance and then help you get seated. Once we were seated the server was quick to take our drink orders. They sequenced our meal properly with adequate room between the appetizers and main courses. They were able to accommodate our party and were very helpful. We had a baby with us and they were always considerate and gave us suggestions to help keep us comfortable. Everyone in our group enjoyed the food and the birthday cake we had brought with us came to the table with candles lit and ready for our celebration.

We were there for Mother’s Day brunch and the server never mentioned anything about it (no “happy Mother’s Day, etc”, forgot an item for one of the mom’s plate and took forever to return to ask us how the meal was before we could mention the missing item. All the moms were supposed to receive a gift, which was a $10 voucher for a return visit which expires in 2 months, however she only gave me one (the younger mom…not the two grammas, who are also moms). It was just a very humdrum experience. We don’t need to return.

My husband was a bit less impressed with his smoked gouda bacon burger.

Our one complaint is that the person who delivered the dessert took an order from us for a couple of after-dinner whiskeys. The whiskeys never arrived. When we asked our waitress about them, she went to find out what happened. Apparently, they were completely out of both whiskeys we ordered, but no one ever bothered to stop by and let us know until WE made the effort to inquire.

When the dish arrived to the table looked good but when we started to eat, all the ribs were burnt at the back. It was all turned into charcoal on one side. 
They put the good side facing up and charcoal side down. And in between big pieces they put small pieces of meat that were completely turned into charcoal to hide them. 
We cancel the rib order and didn’t eat more than what we ordered. We told the server too but she didn’t say anything. 
I was surprised that’s the standard at this restaurant.

Great bar with an excellent selection of beers on draft.
Our server took us through the menu and answered any questions we had. We shared a starter between us as we had been advised about portion sizes by our server. The starter was dumplings which was very good.

Hope this finds you well. 
I just thought I’d put it out here that I was at happy hour with the kids today 
And only the food was at happy hour and they charged the normal price for the drinks - even though cocktails were said to be at 30% off. 
And they said it was  a process that they had to refund and recharge it was taking so long so I didn’t want to waste my time with the kids impatient so I left.

For eg - HH peach at 21 (which is normal price anyway 😬)

But you should know that if you mention 30% off cocktails it should be that :)

Wanted Greek specialties and started with the flaming Saganaki. It was delicious. We ordered the Souvlaki Platter even though the server coached us that it included two skewers each of beef, chicken, Tiger Prawns and salmon. When the platter arrived it was easily enough for four - lol. It was excellent and fed us for the next two nights.

Greatly service  Great location and tasty food. Great value too. It’s just the kitchen is so slow. We waited half an hour before our bento boxes were served.  Food is not bad as usual.  Unfortunately the service was not only slow but also inadequate and of poor quality.   Not to put blame on the staff as they are clearly young Japanese ladies new to Vancouver and might not have worked in restaurants before.  Staff retaining and training could make this place instantly better.  Our group of four couples dined here for third time in the last six weeks.  This time, all of us decided to try the $56 sampling menu, which consists of nine courses, including dessert.  It was excellent and filling, in a good way.

We sat on the patio, which doesn't have a two hour time limit as the interior tables do, and has a retractable roof and patio heaters on either side of our table, to protect us from the possible rain and cold.

The Japanese Izakaya (appetizers) menu is large and diverse, and all the featured items are delicious.  So is the drink menu, including Mega-sized 24oz beers. On Saturdays and Sundays, Happy Hour is in effect from 230 to 530, on most appys and some featured drinks, which means $1 to $2 off on these items.

Their regular whiskey prices are the lowest in town, including double Crown Royals for only $9.50 each and double Jameson's for only $12.50.  Their wine list is a bit limited, but not a deal breaker.

Amazing atmosphere and delicious food. Quality is always top notch.  Great spot. Amazing food. Highly recommend for any gathering.  Considering that I made this reservation one entire month ago, we were given the worst ""table"" in the restaurant. I will mention that there was an option of a table inside or patio seating outside but it defeated the purpose of the rooftop bar.

The table we were led to directly in front of the walkway entrance into the restaurant, and felt like a waiting area. When we asked for the empty table behind the one we were brought to, we were told that it was reserved, just as we had also made this reservation and were there at an earlier time than the party who eventually was seated there.

 I specifically recommended and suggested this restaurant to my friends because of the rooftop setting and beautiful setup, and we were hoping to get nice photos from the night. However, as I stated that it felt the area was more appropriate to be a waiting area, every angle we possibly could have taken photos was very awkward. We had a choice of the elevator, a glass wall with restaurant belongings behind it, or the rest of the patrons as our background. We were not impressed by this, or the uncomfortable seating.

The portions and presentation of the food we do not feel was worth it for the prices.

I have an anniversary coming up and plan to come back 😀  Honestly pleasantly surprised at the overall presentation and multitude of middle eastern flavours from each dish ordered. The Whole Branzino was a standout and very fresh.  Small hiccup with 5th dish ( chicken wings) which took over 20 min but they apologized as they just opened and comped our wine. Service is on point and the fact they were proactive to check in on us was commendable. A lot of restaurants at similar price points can learn a lot from them in how to run a restaurant.

I would highly suggest not wasting your time or money on this lack luster restaurant. 

To call themselves a steak restaurant is laughable. Perhaps they have decent pasta.  

We went as a group of 5. Four of us ordered steaks and all four were horrible. 

My husband likes his steak Chicago blue. The chef came out to tell us they can not cook a steak this way. Odd since even a Keg or Chop can accomplish this. This should have been the first indicator how bad things would turn out. But in all actuality it never crossed any of our minds that this place was so inept that they can't cook a steak as requested. 

So he requested rare and was served well done. As in shoe leather well done. 

The  other steak medium/well came out rare. And the two medium rare came out blue. 

2 steaks were sent back and took 45 minutes to be replaced.  The medium well came out sliced into pieces. The rational we were given was to make sure it was cooked. 

The other rare came back out blue again. 

So the restaurants response was to remove 2 steaks from the bill and offer 2 free desserts. 

$800 later and 4 out 5 guests left unhappy.  Goes to show since we couldn't get Into our go to Hys that a place such as this is not a good substitute. 

Overall the rest of the food was decent but over priced for what it was.  They go so far as to charge $5 for a glass of pop. So when they use 1 can for 2 or 3 drinks that's some pretty crazy overcharging. 

Avoid this place.  

The server did try and was very flustered and embarrassed by the quality of our dinning experience. Read more I went to C-Prime with my partner for our anniversary. 
We ordered some wine, bone marrow, lamb shank, rib eye and a side.

The « colossal » bone marrow was a joke. Massive bone with not even a tea spoon to fill… I mentioned that to the server and seem to avoid the conversation. A bit of a scam when you pay 37$… I was able to use half of a toast..  nice for people coming just for the picture.

The lamb shank was delicious with the polenta and onions, the rib eye was also perfectly cooked. 

We awkwardly waited for a potential dessert for our anniversary, but they just ended up bringing the bill.

Wine rather expensive.  We had an awesome dinner for my partners birthday. The staff are always friendly and very knowledgable about wine a great experience all around.  Honestly one of the worst dining experiences I’ve had in Vancouver, food was not good especially compared to the price and also 12 mussels for a 20$ appetizer, what a joke, portions for an appetizer pasta compared to a main, appetizer seemed bigger which was cheaper… and the saffron rice that comes with the ossobucco milanese was the worst I’ve ever had  The best restaurant experience! 

It was a delight to be served by a completely professional team. Not just the server, who was amazing, but everyone was superb. 

The industry has been watered down over the years but not here. Fantastic!

The food was terrific and the atmosphere, perfect!

Outstanding! Read more Arriva is one of our favourite restaurants. The food and service are always great. We highly recommend it!  One of our favourite dining destinations.

Service was abysmal and left a sour taste on the first night of our Vancouver vacation.

Arrived on time for our reservation of which we made weeks in advance. Took 15 minutes for the waitress to acknowledge us, let alone ask us what we wanted to eat. Once we ordered, we waited 45 minutes before we were changed to another server who then promptly brought the food out. Also did not refill our waters the entire duration of our meal. Tables around us were apologized to for the wait due to a few larger parties slowing down service. We, for what ever reason, were not apologized to which we found extremely odd. After finishing our meals our replacement waitress asked us if we wanted the bill 3 times, to which we said yes, all 3 times.

The patio heating was also ridiculously hot which I’m sure is great on very cold nights but it was melting us with direct heat.

Overall, terrible service but food was great. Wouldn’t come back again and I do not recommended if you’re coming for a special occasion or vacation. Read more Our group of 6 enjoyed a lovely lunch today at Pier 7. It was pouring rain outside however we could still sit out on the covered patio with heaters overhead and blankets offered. Perfect view of the pier at North Vancouver. Our host (didn’t get his name) and our waitress Ainsley were both lovely and helpful and greatly contributed to the wonderful time we had at Pier 7! Thanks to all! Read more We have had a varied quality of experience at Puer 7 over the years, but I receive their promotional emails and loved the sound of the Thanksgivong 3-course menu. So we booked a table for the family, which included our elderly parent, who is mobility challenged.
I called ahead to find out about accessibility to their washrooms, which are on the 2nd floor. The elevator wasn't working, but they kindly offered to have my mother use the staff washroom if need be.

We arrived on time, but had to wait 10 minutes for our table. We stayed for 90 minutes, during which time we did receive our first course and a drink, but service was slow and sparse. Our server Hailey seemed nice enough, but obviously stressed, and unprofessional in her responses to our conversation and even our empathy.

The restaurant was obviously overwhelmed and unable to cope with the volume of business. Guesys at several tables looked unhappy. They ran out of turkey (the reason we went there) before our order was processed, their internal communication was poor, and we eventually left without our main courses even having started being cooked!

Thd only saving grace was that we were not charged for anything. And that would have been the only acceptable outcome. It was a disastrous experience, particularly for pur poor parent, who left in pain from having to sit that long without the dinner out we had promised her, a treat she has not been able to experience for months. Read more We ate thanksgiving menu. Main dish turkey was totally tasteless and portion was cold and also other portions were cold.  I normally do not write reviews, but this experience was so bad I am compelled to do so. Over the years, I and members of my family have gone to Pier 7 and have enjoyed the experience and the food. I have not been there recently, but my wife has and she has noticed a change since 2022. Last night ( Oct 13- Thanksgiving) we had a 6 PM reservation and selected the ""Thanksgiving dinner menu"". It took 2 hours for us to get our food, and when it came, it was simply ""meh.  I could go into details but there is no reason to do this.  It appears we were not alone as several   tables around us had run into the same problem. simply put it looks like bad management, bad planning and bad cooking. It is a shame since the location is ideal looking across the water into downtown Vancouver. With the build out of the Shipyard area, this should be a great restaurant with a fantastic location. Alas, it is not...at least not now! I hope it can find its footing. Read more It was a great place for my daughter’s 40th birthday celebration.

Excellent customer service, fast and welcoming attitude. I high recommend dining here, price is very good. Taste of snack e.g.  wings, calamari have no taste, only taste of spice.

My love for this restaurant is such that I excitedly look forward to it for several days before I go, and when I have reached the dessert course of my dinner there, I feel genuinely sad. Great food, great service, lovely ambiance. I would go every week if I could afford it.  This was only our second time going to Acorn once, and although my partner and I are carnivores through and through, and once again we were so impressed by the food! We have enjoyed the Vegan tasting menu previously and last night we had the Vegetarian 'Everything But The Bird' dinner, and both were spectacular. To be able to create such delicious, inventive and approachable food with the limitation of vegan and vegetarian cuisine is so impressive! The only thing as good as the food is the service!

Read more I chose to go to The Acorn last night to celebrate my birthday, because it's one of my favourite restaurants in Vancouver. I've dined there a few times over the year, and it unfailingly delights. I don't know any other place that elevates vegetables to such culinary heights as The Acorn. Each dish is fresh, creative and lovingly crafted, and so beautifully presented that each plate feels like a work of art. The service is attentive and friendly without ever being intrusive, and the ambience is warm and intimate. We ordered the chef's tasting menu last night, and took great delight in being surprised by the parade of dishes that were prepared for us, each one complementing the last. Really, I can't say enough superlatives about The Acorn. Just go there and see for yourselves! You will be glad you did. Read more Food was lacking in refinement, substance, creativity, flavor. The way things were cut and presented felt amateurish, and the flavor/texture combinations were underwhelming. Left the meal hungry and unsatisfied. The cocktails also not good. However, I will say the servers and wait staff were lovely.  We had the A La Carte dinner menu for 2. I am vegan and my partner is not. Our server was amazing! We didn't know where to start with the menu so our server explained the range of dishes and suggested some of their favorite dishes. The food came out quickly and were absolutely delicious! Overall it was an amazing experience.  We went for the chef tasting menu and overall experience was okay at best. Service was inconsistent (only refilling half of our glasses with water) and not clearly explaining what our dishes were. The rotating feature dish was a Alfredo pasta and it was unbelievably salty and the pasta was over done. We went to Acorn a couple years ago and the experience was a lot better. I would not recommend Acorn anymore as there are other better vegetarian restaurants in Vancouver. Read more Embarrassed that we had not eaten here sooner, but have suffered from vegetarian-only dining-PTSD since eating at The Naam many years ago. Thankfully, there’s none of the snark or self-righteousness at The Acorn that was once dolloped with every dish or answer to a question that seemed to be a Naam specialty (“Can I get a new fork? This one is dirty.” Naam server: “That’s not dirt, that’s Earth”).

Heartily recommend the Harvest menu and wine pairing. The beauty here is that you’re not ‘missing’ meat, or eating dishes that are intended to be meat substitutes. Every dish was savoury, delicious, unique, and beautifully plated and presented. The servers were knowledgeable, responsive, and struck that important balance between being present without intrusive.

My favorite was the white wine sangria, but the cherry margarita was also fantastic.  We enjoyed a family brunch on the patio. Server was very good  Love this place small and intimate yet good vibes. Service was great. We all enjoyed our meals and they have a decent Happy Hour menu! Will definitely be going back!  Wanted an IPA that was $8 but when I ordered he said the keg was almost empty so my only alternate was paying $9.50. No offer to only charge me $8. Also, they we're only offering outside seating despite the inside being completely empty. The inside has a much better feel.  We went for Tuesday pasta night and absolutely LOVED the food. The cream sauce is to die for, generous with the seafood and pasta was freshly made and cooked perfectly al dente. Our appies were also really delicious. The best calamari we've ever had.

I'll be going back for sure to try other things on the menu! Read more Small but good place. Late night happy hour provided good range of food but a bit limited for drinks. Cocktails were tasty. Friendly service that was the right mix of being available without disrupting the conversation.  Very slow kitchen. Lovely server. Bubbles far too pricey and sweet.  What a fantastic happy hour! We had a big glass a wine and shared chicken wings, nachos (fantastic guacamole) and risotto balls. The food and service were great and we had a chance to stroll around Yaletown a little too before hand. Will definitely be back!  Had a great meal at Alchemy. Four friends we shared pizzas and nachos and drinks.

Great spot-convenient and lovely outdoor seating. Food good but not excellent.  Food was disappointing for the price. Too salty and very casual like fast food place.  Fantastic restaurant with excellent service. Would highly recommend.  We got a table on their patio with a cruise ship right behind us.  Tons of great people watching!
Started with steak bites that literally melt in your mouth!! I had steak and lobster which was fabulous and my partner had filet.  Perfectly cooked!  This was a great dinning experience, food was exceptional and service was great.  100% recommend Chop Coal Harbor.  We were visiting from Toronto and wanted to eat steak and it was the best! They had a special steak platter with 3 different types of steak and it was delicious. The service was amazing and the restaurant is very cozy.  Food quality was substantially better than the other standard restaurant chains. A bit of a premium but definitely worth the additional cost. 

Service was friendly and efficient without being robotic.  I appreciated the absence of ""how are the first few bites""

This was my third time at Aleph and I still give it 5 stars!!  Not only is the food here fresh delicious and authentic , but it's one hundred percent plant based. It's really wonderful being able to sit down and a restaurant that does not serve up cruelty to animals. 
The servers are friendly and attentive The menu has dishes that are very diverse of flavors and textures...they have Happy Hour every day from 5-6pm. Lots of delicious choices from both Mezze (share plates)menus!

My friends' drink tasted as if it was straight alcohol, rather than a cocktail and mine tasted like a tablespoon of cinnamon was thrown on the top.

Everyone loved their food. Our server, Ananda, was a delight! She made excellent recommendations and ensured everyone was well taken care of. Great restaurant, great food, great staff!

The spaghetti we were served tasted like it came from a box.  Excellent food always and the Chef/Owner exemplifies how every restaurant should be run .  Sauce were great had some past and some calamari and teh sauce for both were great. Calamari sauce maybe some of the best I have ever had. Unfortunately the calamari was quite rubbery (overcooked)

That was lovely. Thank you so much everyone. Will be back  I am staying at the Paradox so thought this would be a good place to have dinner. Let’s start with the service. I was by myself and I will say couples and Caucasians received better service than me. If you know the DJ or the servers they will be nicer and more attentive. Also on my reservation I put it was my Birthday but they didn’t even acknowledge it. Drinks were okay. My waitress did not tell me about the Martini specials, but she told the Caucasian girls right in front of me. Food was okay. It said on the menu my noodles were supposed to be warm on the Buddha bowl but it was cold. The only thing going for this place is the atmosphere. Very lounge like and bar like. But either than that please learn to be attentive to ALL your guests!! No matter the race!! Read more Karma tofu bowl was amazing! Rish flavours yest so light & healthy.  I think the noise level.was a little too high for a conversation around the table.  Didn't receive the full order (they missed my bread when I ordered an omelette). Then I had to ask for butter which was never brought. There was no salt or pepper.  The portion was awfully small. Although my partner's bowl looked good.  The servers never came back to ask if we needed anything. Just annoying that I had to keep asking for stuff.  

The place looks great but there service and food at those prices absolutely not worth it. If you're trying to be in the elite group of restaurants, then start training your staff or get stronger managers to lead the team properly.  

It's a shame because we wanted to like the place but I would NOT recommend this place.  There are many  better choices within 2 blocks. Read more Thank you for the kind birthday celebration! The cake with a candle and a 'Happy Birthday' sign was a lovely gesture. The food was quite good, though the cocktail was not up to par. The service was a mixed bag - the staff was friendly when we could flag them down, but we often felt forgotten sitting out on the patio. It wasn't easy to get their attention to request things like napkins. The last cocktail was delivered without a tray or anything, just a glass in hand. Overall, the birthday celebration was thoughtful, but the service could improve, especially for the patio area when it's not crowded. I appreciate the effort to make my birthday special.

The server was unfriendly, and seemed like she hates doing her job. She never acknowledged my birthday, and there was no card waiting for me on the table. Only after I went to the hostess stand and inquired why my birthday was ignored, did they present me with a gift card, which I appreciate, but why did I have to ask, if that's their policy for all patrons celebrating their birthday.

The staff were friendly and the food was really high quality.  Overall, the food were poorly made.  We ordered 3 dishes, classic benedict, steak hash, & Thai tea french toast.  The eggs on the classic benedict were pretty cooked.  The egg yolks were hardened.  The potatoes in the steak hash were soaky. At last but not least, the bottom of the french toast was burnt.

The beautiful restaurant and  the lovely, gracious people who were working there.  I had the chicken katsu omurice. It’s not quite what I expect. I thought it’s a dish with soft egg yolk that flows out & cover the rice when you cut into it. However, the taste is not bad.  Booked in for the special Mother’s Day tea.

I got there later than my friend who had already started her afternoon tea set, and I noticed that it was not the same tier as displayed on a banner  in front of the cafe entrance! The picture looked way better, with different deserts and sandwiches.

So I opted for the regular menu instead, and very much enjoyed the fried chicken and biscuits.

But I did go for the intention of having the Mother’s Day tea but after hearing one of my friends sandwich was dry, I thought at $75 maybe I’ll opt out.

I tried her scone and it tasted more like a muffin not a scone. I also tried some of her mulberry or some sort of berry macaron, and it tasted odd like almost stale maybe it was not refrigerated.  She had told our friendly server about the dry sandwich and he said it’s made the day or night before.

Also had to flag servers down for coffee refills, and the bill.  And he seemed confused what I meant by separate bills for the three of us. It  does seem to operate as a cafe, not a restaurant, I mean cafe is in the name but the price tags are of a restaurant that would offer proper  afternoon tea service.

They don't have enough staff to make use of the all their tables, nor do they have enough food because they ran out of chicken haha. Maybe, just maybe it'll get better. The value is okay but the food quality suffers, again because the kitchen can't keep up.  AYCE wings deal on Monday is horrible. They limit your orders, takes a long time to get your food then they rush u and kick you out after an hour and 30 even when you’ve only got served your second round.

Food is consistently great and staff very friendly.  I’ve had many many good meals at Restaurant Yugo. Sadly, yesterday’s lunch fell below expectations. In the past, the King Salmon Ikura Don was excellent. The House Bento also fantastic. But yesterday’s Tontoro Donburi was such a disappointment. I was expecting thin tender slices of meat, but instead the pork was tough. It was sliced far too thick and was difficult to chew. And the rice was hard and lukewarm, not freshly made. Something must have happened in the kitchen. So I don’t recommend that dish.

Thank You, had a great time.  We come here regularly for breakfast. There is not a better server anywhere than Carlos! Food  is always good and consistent.  We had 2024 Mother's Day dinner with five family members @ Acqua Restaurant.  The ambience was great.  A bright dining room with patio, well ventilated, spacious table space.  Vancouver Canucks and Edmonton Oilers playoff was on TV, but each dining table was far apart enough that you didn't hear loud noise.  

High quality food and good portion food with fair value: We had beefsirloin, lamb shank, chicken supreme and 2 West Coast Salmon, all savory and with nutritious vegetables.  

Prices for cocktails, alcoholic drinks, and desserts are reasonable: Acqua Sapphire, Old Fashion, Stoneroad Rose, P49 Lager.  Molten cake, mango berry cheesecake, Spanish Coffee, ice cream with berries are all delicious.

The waiter was very polite with a smiley face and patient to wait for our order.  Food was served hot temperature.  The waiter gave us a complimentary pot of purple African daisy flowers for Mother's Day gift.

I have attended a few payroll seminars in the Executive Hotel.

Overall selection and quality was decent, but it was a pretty lackluster experience. The wait staff was the bright spot for sure.  Overall it was fair.
We were there for buffet. It was a bit chaotic at the greeting/ reception. They checked us in and then the greeter just busy with other guests and asked why we were not following her.
The seat arrangement is abit bizarre because it ‘s a quite far walk from the table to the food stations. Walking pass the bar, to the hallway and make turns then reach the food stations while then carry the drink and food back to your seat; like a marathon.

The food was excellent, though the tiramisu wasn’t very appetizing, and I didn’t care for the Mojito. However, I didn’t mention this to the server.

Always great food. Service was excellent!  Was  quiet at first but got quite busy and loud as the night wore on. To be expected on a Friday night!  The smells, textures and flavour were superb. The service was prompt, friendly and informative. We had the ginger beefless bowl and Philly cheezsteak poutine with sweet chili cauliflower to start. I highly recommend all three dishes.  Fantastic veggie experience. Food will leave you wanting more (if you had room). Would have licked the bowl that the Poutine with miso gravy came in if I could.

Continuously checked in on us, moved us to a new table when our reservation was over so we could stay longer, came quickly before the end of happy hour to make sure we got all out orders in, and really made my birthday special!  Great bar and lots of fun games. Good atmosphere and nice bathrooms  The food was pretty awful. I would definitely go again on a Wednesday night for the drinks and games special, but I wouldn’t eat there again. Be careful when paying the bill: they put our game cards on the bill and then asked for a default 18% tip on the whole bill.  Their raspberry refresher is to die for. Whoever created that drink is a legend. Awesome time last night, will definitely be back  Our group enjoyed our time at Greta as service from Brooke was great and the only hiccup occurred when some of our food was mistakenly sent to another table. Fortunately we were heads down into gaming so the extra wait was fine and we were served pretty quick with the rush put in. Again, Brooke was very apologetic for the issue and it didn’t deter our evening much at all. Food was decent as well and the games were fun!  Will be back again!

That is strange  I suggest this restaurant be removed from OpenTable. I had reserved a table for a Tuesday, which was accepted. Upon arriving, the restaurant was closed with no signage. Their website does not indicate being closed on those days either. OpenTable should have never allowed this reservation to go through.  We booked a table for 6pm on a Tuesday. Showed up and the restaurant was closed, and they never called to cancel my reservation.  So excited to try a new restaurant for us, on an unexpected date night. Found free parking so this was a good sign. Got to restaurant door and noticed lights were off and no one was home. There was some envelope from a law firm taped to the door. We had to find another restaurant nearby to eat at. Sad face.  Really nice location at Stamp's Landing, by the water.  The food was really good, our group of 4 had the combo platter for 2, a couple of appies, and one additional koftes and it was all excellent.  Owner was friendly, greeted each table, and comped us some dessert.  Would recommend.  I’d highly recommend this restaurant who wants to experience Turkiye at the heart of Vancouver!

I made a reservation for 7 PM through OpenTable.

Upon arrival, my husband and I were impressed by the decor and the bustling atmosphere. However, we faced immediate issues: no one greeted us, and we struggled to find where to check in. After some time, the bartender seated another family who arrived after us, despite our earlier reservation.

We were finally shown to our table at 7:15 PM and received a menu at 7:25 PM. The manager took our order at 7:35 PM but discouraged me from ordering the spicy frog legs, suggesting other popular dishes instead. We settled on Chilli Prawn, Black Pepper Chicken, and Fried Rice. Unfortunately, she rushed us and seemed disinterested.

The fried rice arrived at 7:49 PM, just as we were about to leave due to frustration. It was cold, and when I brought this to the manager's attention, she merely nodded without offering an apology or a solution. Disappointed by the service and food quality, we decided to leave without trying more dishes.

While the decor is beautiful, the service was abysmal—far below expectations for a fine dining experience. The waitstaff appeared overwhelmed and unfriendly, which detracted from the overall experience. There seems to be a language barrier affecting communication as well.

Parking is available behind the restaurant, but I won't be returning or recommending it based on this experience. This is the first time I've felt compelled to leave a restaurant without tasting the food due to poor service. Read more Crab fried rice was heavy on soya sauce. $28
Seafood hor fun. Very Salty. $27
6 chicken wings. Very small and over fried. $19
Singapore food for people who have not been to Singapore. Over priced. East Vancouver location at West Vancouver pricing. Interior deco outdated and scarily flowered. One staff acknowledged us calling for her but went on chatting with her other colleagues. I wonder what’s more urgent behind the bar?

Don’t waste your time and money Read more We didn’t notice this restaurant is quite new so staffs are not well trained, menu selections are limited (almost half the menu is either sold out or not available yet), kitchen is slow and almost anything you can think of. Not that I don’t like this place but they definitely need a big improvement before we would go there again. The only good thing is they gave us two $50 coupons, but I don’t think we are going to use them because they expire in October this year and I don’t think we are going back that soon, maybe 6 months later? Read more We visited for a casual dinner with friends, overall it was a pleasant experience. The food was good, though I found the curry fish head a bit on the salty side. The standout dishes were the crispy fried chicken and the grilled eggplant, both were excellent and worth ordering. The service was impeccable and truly enhanced our dining experience. Although we didn’t sample their renowned crabs this time, we’ll definitely try them on our next visit. Read more The restaurant did not check the reservation on OpenTable. We have booked via OpenTable and confirmed the booking but no tables reserved for us on that day.  I would consider this Fine Vietnamese Dining. Unexpected, given the area is not known for fine dining.  I would come back.  The decor is beautiful with great service but the food was better before the new management and the prices are very expensive now. This was one of my favourite restaurants but I probably won’t be coming here anymore  So nicely decorated and i love the ambiance. The food was superb! I loved every plate we had. They even gave us a complimentary dish!  The renovation is lovely and the restaurant looks very pretty. The service was good. The waitress was kind and attentive. The food was much too expensive for small portions, while reasonably tasty. Unfortunately, the night was ruined by very cheesy Elevator music played very loudly. We asked them to turn it down, which they did for a few minutes, but then turned it back back up again Also apparently apparently they do not have a liquor license.

We had really looked forward to our meal at the Greek-Broadway after several excellent experiences at its sister restaurant on the North Shore.  Sadly we were very disappointed.   On arrival there was nobody to greet us and we waited quite a while before we were taken to our table and given menus.  There was no welcome or introduction from our server who quickly took a starter order of dip tasters with pita bread.  These were very good.  Our main course order was for a platter for two of souvlakis.  This took a long time to be delivered and we had finished all the starters some time before it arrived.  When it came the food was only moderately warm - presumably it had been left too long at the chef station.  Our waitress never came to ask us if the meal was satisfactory or if we were enjoying it.  When we had finished what was edible (some was just too cold to be enjoyable) we asked for the bill which we paid and left.  The service was really very poor - we were never made to feel welcome or asked about our experience.  On leaving there was nobody to say 'goodbye'.  Small things maybe, but all part of the usual experience one hopes for in a restaurant.  We will choose the Yaletown or North Shore Greeks in future.

We’re humbled by the outpouring of love and support during our opening previews this week. Thank you for being a part of our journey. We couldn’t have done it without you.,"We were visiting from Portland Oregon so my expectations for a modern take on Indian cuisine was high. Except for the chaat appetizer, which was delightful, the rest of the food was OK. I would never say it wasn't good but it was a bit too removed from its core flavors, perhaps to accommodate a certain type of clientele.  It was too ""chef-y"", if that makes sense. I did appreciate where they were going with it, it just didn't blow me away.

Service was very accommodating, albeit not very attentive.  Overall, it was a decent experience. Read more Delicious food, some of it quite different than I've ever had before. Great service too!  Excellent Indian food, great service and ambience, reasonably priced  Food was great. Love the setting. May need to brush up on the service a bit.  Made a reservation quite awhile ago, and as it was a special occasion for us, asked for a quiet table. Upon arrival, they tried to seat us at a cramped table immediately next to the door. We worked that out. From there everything was great. Food was wonderful and our server was excellent.  Service great, brought us a cake slice for my friends bday .😊
Meal was good but small portions .
Setting was amazing .  The Davie location, too congested  with only a single washroom for women and men. Music bit too loud

While food is ok if is not real authentic food as they try to mix it with a fusion style which does not do justice to real taste of Indian food.

The menu misses traditional staple of butter chicken and tandoori chicken and has something called Angreethi Chicken which  is coal infused but really tasteless .

Gun powder chicken was served cold and is nothing there to really enjoy from a taste perspective.

Curries are filled with same type and too much  gravy.

Good for first time experience but won’t go back again as there are better authentic Indian restaurants out there.

Overall a 2 out of 5 Read more Conveniently located in downtown Vancouver, steps away from the English Bay, this place offers fantastic Indian food and a very comfortable ambiance.

Our waitress was lovely and checked in on us often, the menu is extensive and was able to accommodate all our needs- celiac, dairy allergy, and picky! The price points are great for the size of the serving and everyone left feeling satisfied.  Bad food, a lot of fat in the dishes. A good service  Booked a reservation for dinner before a concert.  The restaurant was busy but there were empty tables, so it wasn't a situation of total capacity.  From the start and still 45 minutes later, our server was constantly making excuses saying the bar and the kitchen were backed up.   Some drinks and food finally came out but were inconsistent with one member of our party not receiving anything almost an hour later.  
The server also said they were out of certain beers yet showed up with a glass of the requested beer?  Allergies were declared and he came back several times to ask about them again and again and just couldn't seem to understand them.  Discussions were then had with the server and then the manager about issues, some more drinks came yet the same member was still excluded from service.  This caused great frustration with everyone; when we made mention of something still not coming the server felt it necessary to tell one of us that they were ""rude"". Our meals were then deemed ""on the house"" by the manager, but there were 2 members that no longer had time to eat before it was time to leave for the show when food finally showed up.  ""To go"" wasn't an option either as we were going to a concert and cannot bring outside food into the stadium.  They had to purchase food there which wasn't ideal considering more waiting time.  Another member of our party, who was actually able to eat their meal, was sick from their food shortly after we entered the stadium.

It was such an overall bad experience, and so disappointing after a family dinner in May at this same location was excellent and fast, service and food were great.  And one could say that we didn't have to pay, so why complain?  At the end of it all, some of us couldn't even eat or drink for free, so it was all just a maddening waste of time which made an impact on our evening out. Read more Great service and food!

No one approached us or acknowledged we were waiting.  After several minutes, we walked through to the new ""back"" area to see if a staff member was there - no.  I then walked over to the Chef and he advised they were not open - I explained we had made the reservation, on line, and had received confirmation for the time and date; his response was ""I don't know how that could happen, we are not opening for brunch until next week"".  So, while we have been very pleased with the food and service on past visits, this one failed. Read more The employees are phenomenal, from the hostess to the waitress to the staff that help the waitresses/waiters. No complaints there. They were an amazing team that worked well together with a good attitude and smile on their faces. However, menu is limited, portions are small, food is ok but not spectacular honestly. It was also very noisy and the music was a little heavy for our liking (rock). Other than the amazing deal on happy hour oysters ($1.50 each), we found it to be quite expensive for the quality and portions. Parking was expensive also. Read more We selected this restaurant based on the excellent review we read online. We assumed this restaurant would have a seaside view and be a seafood place. It was a nice restaurant, but neither facing the harbor nor specializing in seafood. The server informed us it was only open for 2 days. So we were confused about the great reviews?? It was more of a shared small plate restaurant with charcuterie and nice cocktails/wines. Food was good. The server, however, was distracted and never gave us any attention after our order was placed. I had to catch his eye and call him over every time for cutlery, new plates for entrees, to order dessert, and to get the check. He never checked on us, asked if I wanted another cocktail, or even offered my husband a refill on his soft drink. Used restroom on way out and had to tell the hostess that there was no toilet paper in bathroom (they were single stall bathrooms) and trash was all over the floor. They just didn't quite have it together. It was a haul to get there from downtown Vancouver on a rainy Friday night and not really worth the journey. Read more Seafood pasta & Risotto were incredible and platters were more than enough for two people with great pieces - highly recommend  We went for happy hour oysters and not only were they delicious but they were also a great bang for the buck.

Cozy vibes, great friends, and a charcuterie board crafted by a talented chef, Donya—ladies' night just got even better!  What an incredible dinner we had, and the service from Fiona was outstanding. We will definitely be back!  Don't miss their Farmer’s Market Fresh Vegetable Platter! This beautiful and vibrant dish is a healthy option perfect for an early summer dinner. Packed with fresh, colorful vegetables straight from the market, it's both a feast for the eyes and a delight for the taste buds.

We went with a baby and they don’t have changing tables in their washroom. I had to change baby diaper on one of the chairs of the restaurant. Didn’t like the experience.  . My flatbread was cold and burnt and clearly not freshly made - appalling for the price  charged - virtually inedible.
My husband's seafood linguine was tepid on arrival and had to be sent back.
I would definitely not be returning to this restaurant and would not recommend it at all.  The table was not ready for a booked time althouh for only a few minutes.  The staff were great and our food and drinks were quickly ordered .
However, another waiter ( or so I thought) ariived out of the blue and collected plates even though some people had not finished, He then retreated out of view, Our waitress then came to present the bill even though not ask but apparently requested by this other waiter. She seemed confused when we said that we had not finished and order dessert.
This other waiter did not see to serve anyone but prowled about near the windows and looked as if he was the security. His attitude made us feel anxious and probably made the night lrss pleasant Read more Great food happy people working there.  Food was overpriced and sub par.  3 frozen chicken tenders for $25!  Waited forever to be waited on and the waitress was clueless and unfriendly.  Do not recommend!  The food was good and the location convenient as we were staying at the Sheraton.  The menu is not extensive but we were all able to find something good.  There was a band in the dining room that made conversation difficult.  It would have been better for them to be in the bar area away from the tables.  Our server was very friendly and provided us with a list of other places to try in the city at our request. Read more Pretty terrible lack luster food especially at that price point. Service was not very attentive. Nice quiet environment  Can’t actually rate the food, as we never ended up eating here. My colleagues and I came here for breakfast before a conference that we were attending in the Sheraton. We made the reservation for an hour before we had to be in the conference ha, thinking that would be enough time. The waiter was prompt at the beginning and took orders for beverages, then came back to take orders for food about 40 minutes before we had to be in the conference area. Three people were ordering food, and we were told it would not come in time, as it would be at least half an hour. They were not ordering elaborate breakfasts; e.g. the orders were things like avocado toast, no extras or modifications. The restaurant was not busy. We couldn’t understand why it would take at least half an hour to prepare three simple breakfasts. The two colleagues who ordered lattes paid for those (said they were average), and they hoped that those would fill them until the break, where there would be catered snacks from the Sheraton. Our bad for not being upfront about our timeframe and ordering food at the same time as drinks, but we really didn’t think we needed to do that with a full hour of time.

We ordered the salmon set menu and the salmon was not fresh.  There was a tingling sensation to the tongue after taking a bite of the salmon.  Fries were really good.

The waiters were attentive, service was efficient, the room was well-lit and decorated, and the food came quickly and had good presentation. In our most recent experience, we noticed that it took about 10-15 minutes between every interaction with the waiter. This ranged from looking at the menu to ordering food, asking for the dessert,  asking for a takeout box, and getting the bill. Because of the waiting, we probably spent a total of 3 hours at the restaurant for just the two of us when it should have been only 1-2 hours. The restaurant was not busy either so it's strange why service and food took so long. We weren't in a hurry, but waiting 30 mins for our happy hour order to arrive seems kind of long.

However, thought this was going to be a finer dining experience and instead witnessed children screaming and jumping on the tables. It was a little too ""restaurant hotel"" for me.

Needs a server with experience …food was yummy though😊  I really enjoyed the food here. We ordered the truffle fries, scallop risotto and steak and bone marrow rice bowl. The fries didn’t seem homemade but the truffle aioli was soooo good. I practically licked the plate. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto was al dente. Didn’t really care for the pumpkin pieces in the risotto though. The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare. The bone marrow was good too but I’m not a fan of sweet sauces and they put a sweet
Chili sauce on top. It came in a stone bowl which kept the rice super hot and had little crispy pieces on the bottom. The ambience was sophisticated but was confused with the tv’s there. Not sure if they wanted a fine dining vibe or a sports bar vibe. Overall, I enjoyed the food and it was reasonably priced. I would definitely like to come back and try their other dishes, especially when the full menu comes out. Read more Excellent meal at Hestia Kitchen. The place has a bit of a ""secret"" restaurant vibe as it is a bit hard to find and tucked away down a corridor in a semi-industrial building. However, the food makes it worth the effort to find. They are working on expanding the menu and some more fish options would be welcome. The wine list is outstanding with a good assortment of quality wines at reasonable prices. The service was excellent, prompt but not intrusive and genuinely friendly. Highly recommend! Read more Second time here and it was just as good, if not better, than my first visit. The foie gras burger was rich and flavorful, super juicy patty, and the Scallop Risotto hit all the right notes. Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Tasty and creative cocktails too. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Richmond!  We had an amazing time. Service was great. The food was even better. Can’t wait to go back  Would I return to this place in its current state? No. It's like a mediocre and less comfortable Cactus Club or Earls (average at best), trying to be a Joey's, but with a smaller menu and a slightly confused identity.

(1) Grilled broccolini - It's a tiny portion, and the broccolini tasted burnt and dry. The sauce didn't compliment or elevate the star. If anything, this should have been an optional side dish to add to an entree at a lower price point. This isn't a fine dining place. (1/10 still edible, but didn't want to eat it)

(2) Crab + Prawn Linguini - This was ""not bad,"" like a very generous 7/10 in flavour. The amount of ""shredded"" crab meat was decent relative to the amount of pasta, and the pasta had a decent texture.  Prawns were properly cooked. The flavouring of the dish was ok, and the duck yolk sauce was something different. Seafood could shine much more, and the crab meat haystacks weren't attractive.

(3) Steak + Bone Marrow Bowl - At first glance, the steak looked like it had a good cook on it. Strangely, half the steak was rather chewy (not in a good way), and the other half was fairly tender (good thing). Also, the steak lacked flavour. The bone marrow was quite rich as expected, and it was better to mix it with the rice. My friend's order of the same dish had a much larger piece of bone marrow containing more marrow. Check consistency? I really did not enjoy the rice. I know some people like that burnt rice texture from a hot stone pot, but I wasn't really enjoying the many hard plastic-like bits in every other bite that wanted to get stuck in my teeth. The rice was pre-mixed in this sauce so each grain of rice would be coated. The rice's flavouring was too strong and lacked depth and contrast in flavour, so it became dull after a few spoons. The sliced baby king mushrooms were nice. This dish needs more contrasting elements, especially in flavour. Please re-think and improve. (generous 5/10, despite not wanting to finish it) Read more My tap beer was flat with no fizz or foam. Our rice bowl was cold and risotto luke warm. Service was just okay. Food taste alright too bad it's not hot. Overall a bit disappointing. Not in a rush to go back again soon.  The food was actually pretty decent, but the vibe was confusing.   It wants to be high end in some aspects but also tvs with a poker match and then also an office building with shared creepy restrooms.   I was confused but also enjoyed the fries.   Close proximity to the airport was a win.  Good food at a reasonable price. Very good service.  The quality of ingredients was good but the food lacked a certain amount  of finesse to make it exceptional and the service was lacking at times. We were told we would get 10 percent off our bill due to ordering a certain dish but then it wasn't taken off the bill. The scallop risotto needed salt and acid. The best dish was the grilled abalone but even that could have been improved by not serving it on a cold puree. The demi glace that came with it along with the perfect grilling was very nice. The meat was cooked to the right temp. 

They are recently opened so hopefully the service will improve. We had to wait to order, dishes came out piece meal rather than starters coming out together, same for drinks, we had wait to get the check and had to ask several times for it. I think both the kitchen and the servicing staff needs to work on their timing issues. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/67960178.webp

When I asked for a cup of warm water, I flagged to them immediately a big piece of disgusting chocolate/coffee stains on the cup. When the beef was served, the handle of the knife has a very oily texture. I bet it's the dishwasher problem. The beef itself is fine but it is overrated if you call it an AAA sirloin.

DH ordered soup, beef (medium), and crepes suzette.
I ordered duck breast, beef (medium well), and crepes suzette.
The soup had 2 mussels, there were 6 slices of duck breast.

When they bring the crepes suzette, the grand marnier is in a metal container, and the server will pour the whole thing over your crepes suzette. I thought it was too much alcohol.

When we arrived at the restaurant the place had only three tables occupied. One was a group of 10 celebrating a birthday.

There were two wait staff and one was slowly decorating a Christmas tree at the door. When we walked in she looked at us and did not come to great us. She waited for the other waitress to seat us. Bizarre. Things went further downhill from there. This one nice waitress was running around serving all tables and taking care of delivery driver orders while the other waitress just continued to slowly decorate the tree in the middle of dinner service. I commend the one waitress for doing her best.

We ordered the calamari deep fried, the shrimp souvlaki dinner and the lamb shoulder.

Pita bread was one of the highlights. Pillowy soft and warm.

Calamari was the highlight. Flavourful and crisp with a great tsitziki.

Entrees were well portioned, but not great. Potatoes were undercooked, rice was lukewarm and the lamb although was tender was also lukewarm and lacked depth of flavour.

The children were noisy and active, and no attempt was made by the parents to control them. This spoiled our experience.  Excellent customer service and great dinner and the view at the patio stunning  Mediocre restaurant in a gorgeous location. Service was average. Didn’t even acknowledge my son’s 18th birthday. Just really disappointed that we chose that for his birthday. For the price the food was also average.  Had an amazing time here again. The first time was a lovely surprise. The second time I was surprised by the service, atmosphere and food. I can't tell you how amazing those honey butter biscuits are. Just order them and thank me later. The service was second to none.

Service and Servers are always First Tier and much appreciated

R& B Read more Had a terrible experience here a year ago that ruined an anniversary dinner.  A year later we gave it a shot again for a birthday and unfortunately regret doing so.  Specifically reserved a dinning room table for wife’s birthday but was seated on the patio instead.  Service was poor - drinks forgotten, side plates missing for allies (requested but forgotten), two kids drinks and only one straw (requested second one also forgotten).  Waiter couldn’t look at my wife and instead spoke to me and referred to her as “the ma’am” as if she wasn’t there.  1 hour 45min for a salad, steak, and two cheeseburgers.  Food adequate but nothing special, especially given the heavy price tag.  Lousy experience overall. Read more Amazing restaurant - still one of Vancouver’s hidden gems.   Great service, great food, amazing views - I need to come more often !!!  Really enjoyed our time at the beach house as usual. Appreciate your hosts patience with us trying to find the best table for an afternoon meal. My only suggestion is the music. The music seems more conducive to a nightclub rather than a fine dining restaurant. How about some nice afternoon jazz? Not too quiet not too loud? Thanks!  Jarred, our server was exemplary….attentive, professional and friendly and knowledgeable.

Thank you! Great for gluten free - always feel safe eating here with celiac.  First course soup was very tasty and seasonal. The main course…turkey, was dry and tasteless…quantity was plentiful.

We tried to get our server's attention but she was run off her feet. The place was very busy. We emphasized that we wanted to substitute the garlic bread for regular bread. That didn't happen and we were able to tell or server. She returned with a tiny slice of bread. And the price for each was $3.99! The slice was tiny and not worth the price.

The delicious food and exceptional service made for a truly memorable visit. Highly recommended!""  Great food and amazing service!!! We had an appetizer and dinner in the lounge and it was a wonderful evening. The service was top notch, will be back!  I haven’t been to the keg in a while, however we decided to come last night. Nobody came to our table for almost 15-20 as we saw servers walking by over and over. Not even any waters or a greet. We had to ask a server if we were in their section and he politely said no but took it upon himself to get some orders in for us which was very nice. Our server eventually came and she was good however it had just sucked to sit there for so long without an acknowledgement. The sangria was far too sweet and tasted like juice and the espresso martini tasted like frothed water. The food was okay, my boyfriend got a blue cheese steak and he asked for the steak to be medium and it was basically blue rare on the inside. By the time we could tell the server and she offered to have it put back on the grill, the sides were eaten and I was already done my meal by the time he got his back and he had to ask for it to go which a steak from the keg isn’t something you want to take to go, but at that point who really wants to eat a steak that they had to take back, cook again and have two wait for it to come back while all your sides get eaten first and the other person is already done. Just overall the experience was poor and we left feeling disappointed as we normally aren’t people who come out to the Keg very often. Read more Server took 20 minutes to acknowledge we had even sat down, she recommended duck legs said she just had it and it was delicious, husband ordered it and it was dried out and taste less. He had the Oscar on the side the prawns were rubbery scallops were good. Blackened chicken was dried out and hard like it was potting for a long time. Seemed like everyone around us was eating steak so could be the reason for the poor quality of food. Keg quality is not as good as it used to be. Read more Great food 
Great service 
A tad noisy but did not affect our meal  I would have rated the ambiance higher until my guest saw a rat run across the dining room floor, which made us leave right away.

I read a review about a substandard avocado…mine was peak ripeness!  I would definitely come back. Also the GF bun was excellent!  I enjoyed a Cesar salad with apple slices in lieu of croutons and it was very tasty.  Our server was a helpful and lovely young man!  This was our first visit! We were so pleased! The food was so good and the option of chicken with the burgers was a win. We had sweet potato fries to start and they were delicious. Our server Mark was professional and attentive, he offered recommendations and even sang happy birthday with us. We have already shared our great experience with friends and will definitely be back soon. Read more It's the best Vancouver burger. Amazing milk-shake. I highly recommend it.  I choose the Hells Kitchen Burger with avocado.  If the avocado is not good don't use it...it had no taste or texture. Should never been served and sent back to supplier end of story...no excuses.  I didn't mind paying the price BUT if the products offered are not in season, take it off....the server was not readily available to say anything, it was like pulling teeth just to get a refill of water.

Gordon R I am sure would have a few words to the ones putting the burgers together based on what I've seen in his shows.  This was our second visit, I had the backyard burger first time, my husband stuck with the blue cheese burger, we did enjoy both times -- with the exception of the lousy avocado on recent visit.  I would have rathered been told of the poor product and just ordered without or go back to the backyard burger, I would have been happier.  Now we have to consider a third visit.

Service is extremely poor and slow on both our visits and I feel insulted when they expect a min of 18% plus tip for no service.

My rating is a low 4 just because the non ripe tasteless avocado just didn't make the cut BUT the burger itself was tasty as with the fries and served hot as it should be. Read more Love the food it was the best￼ burger that I ever and great service and pice  It was ok. Best dishes were actually the onion rings and fries.  Our server Aayush was excellent , he’s patient, attended.  This was our 2nd time to Gordon Ramsays Burgers. The first time was so good - I loved the onion rings. This was why we went back. We could only get in at 7:45pm which was a bit late for us but they were busy. We ordered burgers and a full order of onion rings. Just before our burgers came out, a manager came and told us they were out of onion rings! I was so disappointed. They suggested the kettle chip nachos (which were $5 more than the onion rings). Everything came out together but we did not like the chip nachos. They had pulled beef and  liquidy cheese sauce over the potato chips. We sent them back. We also had to send the truffle fries back ($4.50 up charge) due to them being cold. The burger was overdone and crusty on the edges. Service was great tho - we got 50% off of our meal & a free dessert. No onion rings tho! Read more This is my second time coming here and both times was amazing.

Celebrated family from Scotland and a retirement with a beautiful view though.  Went for Thanksgiving lunch. Although the food set up was okay, the price point, the service and the overall experience was meh!!  Food was average. For the price charged, it’s not something to be recommended.  Loved the seafood chowder, the calamari, tuna taco mocha ice cream pie. Had great service  A little expensive. Would’ve been nice if they offered some bowls or salads at $25-30 price range.  Beautiful venue on the water. Delicious food and quiet enough to have a nice chat!  Boathouse has been our goto restaurant for over 20 years to celebrate milestone events such as birthdays, anniversaries and special occasions.

This last visit was a disaster.  Our waitress was extremely zealous!  As she walked past our table, she HAD to grab something without even asking if we were done.   This behaviour made us feel rushed and wanted us out of the restaurant.  She even took our bread which she had to bring another one.

My  Togarashi Seared Ahi Tuna was not edible with the 20+ blistered shishito peppers.  I did look up the peppers since I have never had them before.  Internet indicates they're mild but can be spicy.  I ordered the ahi tuna since there was no indication on the menu indicating it was spicy.  It was SO SPICY I only ate a few.  I expected the chef to find a way to balance the peppers to calm the spiciness level.  The ahi tuna has been my favourite for years but prepared differently.

My son ordered the Thai Glazed Black Cod and it was $36 on the website vs the $40 on the restaurant menu.  Our waitress just shrugged it off.

Our reservation was made using OpenTable.  99.9% of the time, I get a notification from OpenTable indicating I have checked it.  This time it was different!  Nothing.  I had the call in to confirm we were in fact checked in correctly.  Just not sure if this was intentional or unintentional or just a 'glith'.

This recent experience has got me thinking if we should continue to support the Boathouse.  Service and quality was horrible on our last visit Read more The food was mediocre at best.  The Cesar salad had no real parmesan in it.  The chicken was cooked well for the price it's not worth it.  The Poke bowl was terrible there was so much water in the bottom it wasn't finished.

The foods we ordered came relatively fast and were good tasting but the portions were not great and hence a bit lower prices. The taste was good and no complaints there.

Only thing that got a star off for me was the fact that I book through open table and mention the occasion and in this case a birthday but not getting any acknowledgement or action from the server is a huge disappointment and a let down for a franchise like them.

An hour into arriving we finally had the bottle of wine delivered.
When ordering dinner, they were out of the pasta dish, but this was not stated at time of ordering.  Advised 15 mins later.  I ended up ordering coconut shrimp which were burnt and overcooked.  I ordered a side of fries and was charged 14 bucks.

I don't know how to get a better table the this app.. a better table is had by just walking in  Friendly service, but attention to details could be improved.  For example- had to ask for water glasses and coffee to be replicated.  Food came out at different times and not all together.  Very fun night with great energy with their October Fest staff in full costume and live entertainment.  Food was delicious! Staff were very responsive.  Schnitzle and Spaetzle, OMG, so good.  You can’t go wrong with the food and the view every time!  Reserved a spot on the patio on a sunny Sunday for brunch. Food and the view was excellent. Had the salmon Benny and a few mimosas.

The tea I ordered came in a damaged tea pot where the lid could not shut within an inch or more of the pot so cold tea.  Garlic mashed potatoes were runny.  Garlic cheese bread was dry.
Complete disappointment.  The Keg used to be a predictable sure thing.  NO MORE.  Will never go back. Read more We have enjoyed going to the keg for special occasions over the years but this visit was very disappointing. The salads were 1/2 the size they used to be and our waiter seemed like he would rather be anywhere else than there.

This Keg never disappoints. Great food and service.  I haven’t been too impressed with the Keg lately.  The steaks are decent - worth the money. However the sides are lackluster. There’s never anything new or elevated to understand the price tag on the entree. I paid 39$ for a decent 6 oz steak but the garlic mashed potatoes are the side they have had for decades… what about a potato croquette?? Something new heaven forbid. And the veggies were huge chunks of carrots and a few green beans. Not farmers carrots that are different colours or long and skinny appetizing looking carrots l. I feel like the meal was closer to 20$ than 40.  Not too impressed with Keg entrees anymore. For what our family of 4 paid I could have bought a better cut of meat and made more appetizing sides.

Awesome  Victoria was attentive, helped with our menu selection, and on top of everything. As always the food was delicious. Thank you for another great evening.  Dinner was awesome as usual and Jesse W was a great waitress  I made a reservation for 7:00PM and the day of the dinner my family wanted to try and move it ahead an hour or more. I told them it was too late (it was 5:00PM) and we went in at 6:30PM hoping to be seated soon. To our surprise our table was open and waiting. Alex, our server, was very knowledgeable and cordial throughout the meal. He took our orders and was able to oblige with changes such as mushroom rice instead of garlic mashed potatoes. The venue itself was clean and there was lots of space to move around between tables.

The food was top-notch. Meat was done to exactly the right colour and accompaniments like garlic mashed potatoes, mushroom rice and salads were very fresh and well-prepped. Nothing was overcooked, wilted, or watery. Everything was very tasty and enjoyable. Because it was my wife's birthday she got a complimentary dessert. The rest of us were so full we declined dessert, but hers was so big she insisted we all have some. Even better, Alex brought it out with 4 spoons so we didn't even have to ask for them.

I'd often wondered how The Keg Southpointe was doing given the number of years we hadn't been there and things like COVID affecting businesses. However, the night was special because The Keg took very good care of us and I have to say that even restaurants who declare themselves to be at or above this level of care and attention just don't meet it. Considering you can adjust the fare to your budget all in all it's a great place to eat. Don't miss dining there. Read more Top tier service exceptional food excellent cocktail menu  On Sunday, October 13, my husband and I came to your location to celebrate our one first wedding anniversary at 6 PM, the reservation was under Jay Hauca.

We will start by saying that our server did a good job, however the food, particularly our steaks were EXTREMELY disappointing and far below what a steakhouse should be serving. 

My top sirloin steak was ordered, medium and was served VERY rare and was sent back twice and could not eat it and left it on my plate. 

My husband ordered a New York strip loin medium rare and it came very well done and tough. So as he was eating his dinner, I had nothing to eat and when mine came back for the third time it was barely warm and too tough to eat. 

At this point, neither one of us came close to even touching our steaks and our asparagus was inedible so we asked our server to remove our plates.

To be honest, our expectations when we go out for dinner at a “Steakhouse ” is that at the VERY minimum our steaks should be cooked and prepared to perfection. Especially at steakhouse prices!

Although the staff comped part of our meals we seriously question whether the Keg should be considered a steakhouse. Read more The service and food was great.  We will be returning.  My siblings and I were here for dinner and had amazing service and food. Always a good time at this location. Our server was awesome - I forgot his name, sorry.  Our server was amazing!! The restaurant atmosphere was great. The bar drink was lovely. 
The food left a lot to be desired. The calamari was dredged in a nice coating of crispy batter but lacked any flavour whatsoever. It tasted like flour. The side dips were lovely especially the garlic one. The cheesy garlic prawns had a weird sour taste to them. My teen pronounced that mine at home is far superior. The shareable Mac and Cheese my teen also said that he’s had way better from a food truck.  The only decent entree was the steak and lobster. But when my husband offered my other son a bite, he said “that’s okay dad I wouldn’t want to eat half your steak” referring to the size of the 8oz  sirloin. 
Our overall experience was enjoyable but the food quality definitely emphasized that for the price of a $64 entree there are better places to eat in the lower mainland. It reiterated why we haven’t been back in years and will probably not go back again. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/51436907.webp

Would return and recommend to friends for view  Our beautiful (inside and out) young server was amazing. It was our first time dining there as we are from out of town. She was lovely. ❤️  Great service. Courteous staff.
Delicious food good wine list  We have been coming to Catch Kitchen & Bar for a long time now for their lobster tails dinner and they never disappoint but last night,the lobster dinner were very very good, the lobster scraper they provided us help us get all the meat out of the lobster.
Our server was very attentive but not intrusive which is very nice.

Catch Kitchen & Bar is our very favorite sea food restaurant! Keep coming over and over sgsin!  The fish and chips were almost inedible, fish was over cooked and the chips were cold and overcooked  Love to come to this restaurant on second floor with waterfront view. Good price point on menu.  Not excellent food but good overall. Love their pasta.  Friendly hostess and nice view.  Enjoy the environment.  Went to the Catch with my wife, daughter and niece for dinner. Made reservations in advance. The restaurant was not super busy. The staff were polite, however the service was none existent.  The waitress took our order, we ordered some wings and our mains. We only saw the waitress again when she brought the food, we had to ask for our water to be refilled. It took almost an hour from when we ordered our mains for them to arrive. The food was good,  but the lack of service really disappointing. So if you go to the catch set your expectations low for service. At least the view and sunset was nice.

Only issue is they need some kinda door or wall to seperate the kitchen. The guy back there was very loud yelling at the cooks and we were sat right next to the kitchen so that was not enjoyable.

First time going to this location, and it’s not that big so The noise level was very high.
We didn’t get checked on much by our waiter. My steak was kind of tough.  We had a good time, the food was good but there were a few things that could have made it better. The timing of our food seemed rushed we didn't have time to eat our appetizer before the entrée arrived and they did forget to bring our side order, they made it up with a free dessert.  We had a fantastic experience with Andrew at The Keg! He was attentive, funny, and kind, making us feel well taken care of. As long-time patrons of The Keg, this was our first time learning about the Keg Classic meal, which included everything we normally order separately. It truly blew our minds—we’ve been missing out on this better deal for years! Also made us feel comfortable bringing our newborn with us on our first ever date.

This time the food was so salty I had to send it back and they did not provide a discount. The lamb chops (whether the rub or the sauce) was salty enough to burn my mouth.

My wifes steak while cooked well, the fries were so salty she left some in the plate.

I have never left lamb behind and she has never let a fry die on a plate. The food was very very poor.

Not noisy like some restaurants  5 diners for brunch. They got eggs wrong for one order, forgot the egg on another and most of the meal was lukewarm.

He finally figured out after we provided instructions. Overall experience is excellent.  Was amazing; food was good and waitress was very nice!!  The food is always great here. No exception this time. Service was great.  Lunch with a group of 6 today.   The restaurant was empty today at noon.   Although our group did not all arrive until about 12:20, it took until about 1:10 to take our order and delivery was slow.  The food was somewhat acceptable, but three appetizers were ordered.  One was eventually replaced owing to misleading ingredients, and two bites were ordered off the bar menu.  One of the bites was advertised as a lobster role.  It was actually a couple of spoonful's of what could be described as lobster salad in a small ban mi bun.   The other was also a very small ban mi.   Very poorly designed bites that were mostly bread.   The korean chicken sandwich was also small and very underwhelming.   It was listed as being accompanied by cole slaw.  In fact about one small spoon of cole slaw was included in the very small bun.   The plate was unappetizing owing to the haphazard pile of fries, with no greens or any colour.

Portion was small and very slow to arrive at the table

Disappointed Read more Dinning at The Italian Osteria is always a great experience. Food and service is always fantastic. Congratulations!  We always love The Italian, the food is delicious and the staff is very accommodating, the prices are a bit high, but so they are in most places these days  The food has definitely gone downhill since our last few visits.  Had a reservation for a birthday. When we walked in we wait 20 minutes to even speak to a hostess. I understand that they were having a busy night but to not even be acknowledged for 20 is a little unacceptable. After finally speaking to the hostess we still waited another 15 minutes. After finally sitting down, we ordered drinks. My partner ordered the red house wine. When we received it we noticed it smelted a little off but we just brushed that off and tasted it anyway. It was absolutely rancid. We then waited 45 minutes for two pizza. At this point most of the restaurant had cleared out. The pizza was very dry and had literally no sauce or meat on it with a light sprinkle of cheese. After putting in the reservation notes, telling the hostess and telling our server it was my partners birthday ( not that we were expecting anything really ) we assumed that the usual restaurant tradition is that there is a birthday dessert on the house. This the case for the people at the table beside us with the same server but not us. After this restaurant coming highly recommended by many people I am very sad to say I am highly disappointed. The only thing pleasant about this experience was our very kind server. She was incredibly nice throughout our experience but there is no excuse for the was this restaurant is being run, especially on a Saturday night. After hearing many groups around us talking about how this restaurant has gone downhill, all the people at the front doing takeout receiving $50 gift certificates for their weight time and the very large group of 10 people behind us receiving their entire bill for free, yet we didn’t even receive a free birthday dessert is quite disappointing. I unfortunately wish I had just left like I thought I should after waiting 20 to even speak to the hostess ( I understand she was very stressed with everything happening) but this was just so disappointing. We had a reservation for a birthday but unfortunately the experience was saddening Read more Experience was very good. We had three younger kids with us, server was quick and efficient and food was really good.  First visit to The Italian and certainly not my last! The ambiance and decor is stunning. Spacious, casual and modern without being boring.
It was a lovely surprise to receive the complimentary salad before our meal but if you try nothing else, you must order the focaccia bread! We asked for it with simple olive oil and balsamic and it did not disappoint.
The pasta was delicious as expected.
My next visit will be during a Seahawks game, sit at the bar, have a wine, the focaccia bread, salad and enjoy the game. Looking forward to it! Read more Food was great tasting and pasta arrived hot.

Overall, I wont be returning.  This was our 2nd visit. This time we came to try the lobster pasta served tableside in a cheese wheel. Everyone was friendly and went above and beyond. After enquiring about the table side service the server let us know the chef was running to the store to get another torch and would let us know the status of that. The manager came right after and said it would be 20 minutes till the chef was back with the torch. We still had appetizers coming and decided to wait. The manager comped our appy's which was something she didn't need to do. The food was top notch.  We will be back for sure. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/50534095.webp

Not great ambiance.  Food tasted good in comparison to quick serve counters at the airport. Service was a little slow, but that seems to be the norm at several airport food spots that we've eaten at. We ran into an issue with a couple of small fees being added to the bill. The server could not supply a paper bill and only showed us how to get the electronic bill when we made it clear that we weren't paying until we could see the bill. When we pulled the details and saw the fees this is when the server admitted to the fees being there, not sure why they were added, and that she couldn't get them off of the bill we saw, but kept telling us they were removed in the system. When you manually added the check up, it was very clear that the fees had not been removed and we were being asked to pay an amount with the fees included. When it was clear to the server that we would not pay the bill until it was correct, she got her supervisor to help correct the matter. While it was not a lot of money for the fees, it was the principal of the matter and just felt a little shady. Thankfully our itinerary allowed us the time it took to make sure everything was correct before paying. Read more Salad was wilted and brown. Burger was hard to cut through.Service was great though!

Nice that we could reserve a table in security line up.  Waited forever for mediocre food. Our waitress was inattentive and didn’t bother to refill drinks or even check in. The food is overpriced and way underseasoned. I’d skip this place and spend your money elsewhere. $100 for a 2 person lunch and the food was bad.  Great food and excellent service

This has been our favourite Greek restaurant for many years. We went last night for our anniversary dinner as we do every year,  but we were disappointed for the first time ever.
When we sat down we noticed the white tablecloth had food on it from the previous diners. I noticed that there was a dirt stain (maybe from peoples hands) on a wall and the trim needed some paint.
We always order the calamari dinner. The calamari was dry and very chewy. (The side dishes were good)
When I made the reservation I had said we were celebrating our anniversary. We’ve always been gifted a dessert to share but it never came.
It was also so noisy we could barely hear one another talk. I realize that is just the way it is when there’s a large group but it didn’t help how we were feeling about the whole experience. Read more Excellent dinner and service. I didn't think the prices were unreasonable for what we received and given it's 2024. Portions are quite large for a few entrees. My wife is a huge Greek food lover, we will definitely be back!  All went well.

Of course, at dinner time, EURO games were already over so a COPA game was on instead. Spain had won earlier in the day so everyone was happy and excited.

Hidden gem!  Don’t let the industrial area fool you, this is a super cute space with incredible food! Everything was so flavourful and fresh. The rib meat dish is out of this world!

Everything we ordered was exceptionally delicious! I keep coming back!  Jamoneria by ARC is the best Spanish restaurant and best Spanish store in the Lower Mainland.  We love the restaurant food, the conservas, the Jamon Iberico, and the Spanish almonds.  Service was friendly and food/drinks came out promptly. We loved the white sangria and charcuterie items we ordered it was delicious however the octopus, shrimp, and cheese plate we received the portion was very small for what we anticipated to pay. The location makes you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere which isn’t a bad thing to me it’s a quiet spot so great for catching up one on one with friends or even to have a date night. Quality of charcuterie items are excellent but I do hope the restaurant can work on their portion sizes for everything else. Prices are expensive. Read more Excellent food. Took me back to my days living in Spain. Highly recommend  I’m very happy to see the aged steak back on the menu.  It is amazing.",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/49977457.webp

Built in 1918, it was the residence of Lou Jack and his household until it was converted into a restaurant in 1974.

The interior has a crisp, clean aesthetic that is enhanced by hardwood floors and the enlarged photos of historic Surrey that adorn the walls. There are five distinct dining areas on the top floor (including a cozy library) and a banquet facility downstairs. The cuisine is French with a splash of West Coast flare. A treat for new and seasoned guests alike are the signature dishes that are prepared and flambeed tableside.

The restaurant has been family-owned and operated since 1974 and in 1984 the restaurant has entered into a partnership with the family farm in Ryder Lake overlooking Chilliwack from the nearby mountains. The Old Surrey is well known for its free-range lamb and veal allowing customers to enjoy fresh organic ingredients.","Read more Great Restaurant.  A real throwback to more decadent times.

I then complained to staff that cask should not have resos linked to open table because if not checked into restaurant customer gets dinged and can’t book if not resolved
They told us upper management knows.Felt very unwelcomed at host stand when acted like we did not belong there.Usually manager greets or comes around.No manager at all.
This was not a good introduction for my friends.

Food was good for price but some things didn't taste very flavourful like the bone marrow probably cause the flavour was masked by pickles. Whiskey was as expected. 

Overall an amazing place and would go back. Read more The restaurant called beforehand to confirm my reservation and I also disclosed that it was my mom's birthday for the occasion. As a result, we decided to bring a cake to celebrate her birthday. However, upon arriving at the premises, we were only informed that no cake was allowed. 

This information is very important and should have been shared with us during the phone call, which would have saved us the trouble of bringing the cake with us and taking it back entirely. It isn't mentioned anywhere on their website or social media either, therefore, there was no way that we could have checked. Despite it not being our fault, the restaurant still decided not to accommodate us for the inconvenience they caused.

The waitress was very sweet and provided us with free birthday drinks, but the miscommunication on their end has already slightly ruined the night. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/46823515.webp

Read more The parking is very difficult. I spent almost 20 minutes to find a spot.  Odd service (made a comment about my portion/how much I ate) and food is overpriced for what it is.

Wasn’t impressed, very expensive, not much variety on the menu, one of our steaks was 3/4 fat, they did bring another but it just ruined our experience. The waitress was very friendly, not her fault  We enjoyed the happy hour menu with Margarita flights! Everything was delicious and our server was excellent, you could tell he takes pride in his job.  Have been several times and each was a great evening. Food was excellent, service was exceptional and our server was  a super person and was able to make suggestions which were perfect.  Will certainly be back  Simply an all-round great experience. Attentive staff, great surroundings and ambience, excellent food and wine.

Shared charcuterie and cheese board with a cocktail for aperativo, followed by the Chorizo pasta dish for me. Our other diners were on the butternut squash ravioli and seafood risotto. Portions were perfect. Enough to eat without waste. Perfect.

Read more We went for the Thanksgiving three course. Service was excellent. The live music was fine from where we were seated but quite loud at the staircase up to the restaurant.

My companion enjoyed her salad starter. My butternut squash soup was tasty but closer to a puree in texture and it would have benefitted from a little stock or cream.

The turkey dinner was very good. The turkey was moist, the mashed potatoes were smooth and the gravy added a lot of flavor. I would have preferred more veggies and less potatoes, but the proportions were pretty standard for most restaurants.

The pumpkin pie was smooth and tasty, if a little cinnamon forward. It was a bit surprising but I liked it.

The evening was a success until we received our bills. Two of our group who had ordered a glass of wine were charged $3.00 more than what the menu said it was. When brought to the waitresses attention, it was changed. We wondered how many people don’t even notice when they pay their bill.

Thank you for the awesome food and service 😊  Always great service at this location.  Food is really good, a bit pricey but still good.  The only thing I’m having an issue with is the 22% tip I think that is ridiculous.  The food was Mediocre. Rather bland for 100 bucks.

Just a quick dinner out but the steak hit the spot. The margarita was very good!!!
Service was perfect.  Overall good. I had shrimp tacos which were good. Service was good one of the steaks tasted off so they remade it and manager came by to apologize.  We used to love this place, the food was always good, the prices were fair and the portions were good. 
The last handful of times we’ve been there it’s been decreasing in all of the above. 
This time was the last straw, it took several minutes for us to be noticed upon arriving, we had a reservation but it wasn’t needed as it was a slow Thursday night, the service was okay although she didn’t check on us at all after providing us with our order, the food was mediocre at best and the portion sizes were small, there was no more than a handful of fries on the side of the chicken sandwich, do NOT order the Nashville chicken, we had both the appetizer and the sandwich and both were extremely underwhelming and not at all crispy.

Never again. Service was really good though.  This is the first time we were at Oak & Thorne; we went for brunch on Sunday and got the ""special"". It's different from other JRG establishments where we got the special brunch. Oak & Thorne have Yukon Fries instead of hashbrowns, which we prefer, but I'm not complaining, just making an observation.  Great Service! From the moment I reserved a table to leaving staff members were so attentive and the friendly!  I visited for the England game and you obviously underestimated how many would show up. The servers were great but very overwhelmed. It was two hours before I got my second drink. You lost out on a lot of business I am sure.  Staff was accommodating on a busy day seating us with 2 very young children. Unfortunately my eggs benny was not up to par. Tasted sour and not in the good way.
Food is not usually an issue here for me, so hopefully it was just a one time thing. Will be back.  Went there with co workers to watch UFC 304 fight . Great service great food and a fun environment . Always go there to watch the UFC fights and after the event they have a Dj that starts the party . Good times !!!  Some of our appetizers were cold, some were fine. Service was less than good , very very slow to get drinks and any service  We had Mother’s Day lunch here and the food was tasty and reasonable. We were offered a free drink for the moms and our server was so attentive. I had the breakfast special. It was enough food and you can’t beat the price for $6. Wow! We’re definitely coming back here!  My chicken salad was dry and had not taste.  Service was super slow and we were the first ones in the restaurant.  Food was disappointing, everyone I was with was dehydrated for the next 24hrs from how salty it was. Service was friendly and attentive.

The place is nice but the service is terrible.  The food was excellent and the service was great. The manager put her hand up when I tried to ask he a question. Then she ignored me when I tried to get her attention which I thought was rude. Our server was great and helped out when she returned from serving other tables.  Our family wanted to sit in the restaurant but we had to sit in the bar during UFC fight night. It was too loud and not the right environment for the children. If your not going to open the restaurant we will choose some place else.  Food was delicious however service was very disappointing no one in the restaurant but they had 4 servers on and we still waited 20 minutes before asking are drink order and another 20 for our drinks to come. Seemed they didn't care about quest service or wanting to please whoever ordered from the casino..  Ordered two appies and two kid menu items for family. Took over an hour to get food. Once it came our nachos were cold - cheese was not even melted throughout. Unfortunately, very disappointed. Langley location was great, but this was the opposite.  Poorly cooked food. Burnt corn bread. Raw unseasoned coleslaw  We were a party of 6 sitting on the patio.  Another party was seated just before us and received their entire meal and bill before we even received our appetizer.  We had only ordered 1 appetizer and it took more than 30 minutes to arrive.  The waitress said that she had forgotten to enter the appetizer so she held our main course for a few more minutes so we could eat the starter.  The food ended up being cold when it showed up.  It also took a long time for our second round of drinks to arrive.  The restaurant wasn't busy as there were only a few people on the patio and almost nobody sitting inside.

I ordered a steak sandwich and asked for it to be cooked medium.  It was extremely over cooked to well done.  

We live in Squamish and have been coming to Match for years but are getting frustrated with the continual decline in the quality of food and poor service.  We like to bring friends there as the patio offers great views of the Chief but the disappointing quality of the meal makes for a less than pleasant outing.

JOIN US!","Have been having lunch here for the past 7 or 8 years - food is consistently good. Service always excellent.  Service is always good and the food was great. Music was not appropriate and too loud.  We both had two kinds of pizza with béchamel sauce and different toppings... (pear/pro) and ""black & blue"" and the crust in both was made to perfection.  The toppings were just right and the smoked beef brisket on one was delicious.  Very generous portions and despite it being very busy , the service was excellent.  The chairs are getting very worn out, they need to have the upholstery replaced,  we received our meal and had to wait a minute or so for the cutlery. Overall not impressed. The server was quite attentive though.  The service was great,  casual atmosphere The bar tender and watress were terrific. chicken bowl was fabulous. My friend had the fish and chips  which were good but overwhelming amount of French fries. Cider thumbs down , Caesar  was excellent. Used elevator to get upstairs but couldn’t get into the restaurant. The door out to the sidewalk wouldn’t open .  Had to call the restaurant to get someone to come outside and move a very large planter for us to get in. .. Read more We go here at least once a week, this time the pizza was under cooked and soggy on the bottom
Not impressed, hopefully not the norm going forward  Popped in here a few months back for lunch. Food and service were great. So we decided to give it another go. Looking online they had a completely open schedule for reservations, so we opted not to make one as it didn't seem necessary.  

We walked in to a mildly busy restaurant just before 7:00pm. 5-6 staff members looked directly at us and didn't acknowledge us at all. After about 10 minutes, someone finally came and asked us if we had a reso and when we said no, she told us it would be a 30 to 40 minute wait. This seemed silly as there were at least 6 tables open and staff seemed to be milling about. Annoying to wait so long for that info!

Went back to the car and, out of curiosity, checked again for reservations available on OpentTable. They were open for every time slot, so we made one for 7:30pm, and walked directly back in. We waited another while for someone to acknowledge us and were sat immediately.  

The hostess explained that the kitchen was backed up so they weren't seating people. Interesting policy...why not give us a warning about delayed food and allow us to sit and have a drink at one of the empty tables or the bar?

We had to flag down a waiter to get drink menus as we weren't given any. He was friendly and informative. He took our drink orders and told us our waitress would be by to take our food orders. However, it was him who came back to check on us and we never did see our waitress.

We ordered drinks and the artichoke dip (great) which arrived very quickly (backed up kitchen?). At the same time we ordered mains; a burger & salad (meh), and the fish & chips (generous and cooked well, but flavourless). They came about 4 minutes after our appy arrived!

Ordered a second drink when mains were delivered. It arrived almost 15 minutes later. It was so salty it was undrinkable.  And empty plates sat on our table for 10 minutes while a waitress cleared vases from all the other tables.

Only highlights were the dip and the friendly waiter. Read more The food was okay but watch out for the wine list! The prices went up but the oz went down.  Terrible wait staff. A joke really. Despite having a reservation, as if we were somehow an inconvenience just being there.

We had to constantly swat them away from our food and from landing on us.

Service was the best part of our dinning experience. Was on a Sunday, so not overly busy, so we were able to have a conversation. The food was ok, as the beef dip ( 2 orders ), was very fatty, and the au jou was very salty and tasted more like soy sause. Corn chowder, buttermilk chicken sandwich and garlic cheese bread were all decent.

The vegetables were so overcooked they were almost unrecognizable, and overly seasoned. Perhaps they were from the previous day, so warmed up and given a light flogging. The stuffing  was very salty but edible. I liked the mashed potatoes. The gravy was a bit salty but acceptable. The turkey was not tender so I didn’t have much but asked to take it home.  
   I’m a person who loves stuffing but even though my friend didn’t want hers because it was salty and offered it to me, I refused. She did eat all of her turkey but not much of her veggies. There was an orange bit she offered, saying she couldn’t tell what it was, carrot or squash. I took it and decided based on texture it was probably carrot but I was guessing. And all of it was heavily sprinkled with what had been dried herbs. 
  For take-away I was presented with a small container, with no offer to help me even though the plate was large and heavy.  I think the server was wise not to have asked how things were because I would have told her. My friend, who had only her turkey and potatoes, said she thought the food was good.  I don’t think my friend cooks much though and I do. The food would have had to have been quite a lot better to be classified as ‘good’. 
  Salt spring has a terrible time getting proficient help but we had an early sitting so I am wondering if these veggies were left over from the previous day’s Thanksgiving Special. What I do know is that I would never return to the Salt Spring Inn.

Did not get explained how the VIP experience worked. Over priced food and drink. Food was mediocre and cost ridiculous for food that I could make better at home.  This review is mixed so when we arrived we were told to select any table which we did but then took the server some time to come and acknowledge us which is not that welcoming…he apologized then we started to put our order in and they were out of a lot of stuff and on-line menu didn’t match the menu that we received…he apologized then we were going to order our goodies for the movie and he said to wait till we get into the theatre so we did and again they didn’t have the items on the menu…she apologized sounding like a run-on sentence yup but so were the apologies. They say they didn’t anticipate the volume of people because of Top Gun movie I get it but this is Top Gun/Tom Cruise not sure that franchise didn’t sell well.

The waitress could not get our order right. The bill was a mess. We didn’t end up getting 2 orders of fries and 2 drinks that we paid for - and gave up trying.

The service was good and the food was delicious.........until we were getting ready to go to our movie after dinner and wanted to order one more drink to head in with and pay our bill but our server was no where around. We found another server and found out that there were some issues going on with the billing system and our server was dealing with them. We now only had 5 minutes until our showtime.

He then came and found us and gave us complimentary passes and popcorn to any movie another time. Nice to see them go that extra mile to keep customers happy. Read more They were not ready for our reservation when we arrived, they said ""well no one told us"" since the restaurant was not busy I asked if they could just push some tables together to accommodate us and it took almost 20 minutes to complete this. Ordering was prompt but when the food came out it came out in bits here and there with the last two people getting their meal when the rest of us were done. When requesting the bill the server then told us that there was an automatic 18% tip on the bill which was fine as we were a larger party but then when I reviewed the bill noticed he actually charged us 20% tip. We felt really taken advantage of because of this which ruined any good experience that we could have had.

A few employees were waiting at the door and were surprised that we had a reservation since the entire theatre including the dining area did not open until 6:15.  Our movie started at 6:30!!!  I would appreciate an explanation as to why I was allowed to make a 5:30 reservation through the OpenTable app if the dining is not available at that time.

We were pleasantly surprised to find out there was a delicious turkey dinner offered as we were not going to have our traditional Thanksgiving dinner this year.
The service and ambience was great . Read more Overall happy to try it but felt let down.  The new server was quite nice and attentive. The pork belly was dry and overcooked along with the duck needing something more... maybe a seared skin. It was bedded on burnt potatoes. Washrooms were out of order and the lights constantly flicker.  We loved it. Great service and even with several tables full, the layout and structure kept the noise to a minimum. Food was delicious , not a scrap left on our plates! Would definitely go again.  One of the best meals we’ve had in years. LOVED it here. Can’t miss!  We dined here to celebrate an anniversary. Food was beautifully prepared and served. The reason for the 4 stars is that my tenderloin steak was overcooked - ordered medium-rare but was medium, thus not as juicy as I would have expected. Overall, an exceptional dining experience.  We went for our wedding anniversary which we noted on our reservation but were very dissappointed that it was not recognized. This is a first at this restaurant that we rate so highly.  Chasters is one of the best restaurants on the Coast. We went recently to celebrate an anniversary. The Bonniebrook Basil Bomb martini was a fantastic start. The focaccia served with our drinks was fresh and delicious. I had the beef tartare and my partner has the beef salad to start. Both were delicious. My halibut was done to perfection and my partner loved his sirloin steak with frites. Unfortunately we did not have room for dessert.  We were seated on the deck with its beautiful view of Georgia Strait. Our server said whales are often seen, although not that night. For such a high quality restaurant, the atmosphere is very low key. My only caution is that the main courses are quite expensive in the $50 to $60 range. Read more We had a beautiful meal celebrating our 25th Anniversary. Every bite was delicious. My husband loved the duck breast and I had the ling cod. So so good. Well presented.

No offers of 2nd cup of coffee. Had to ask for more water.  Beverages should be available at buffet.  Buffet - no fresh salads- just corn and potato,  then the hot foods which were just barely warm consisting of white rice, small roasted potatoes, lasagna (I think that’s what it was consisting of mostly pasta with no sauce), chicken drumsticks and wings.  That buffet was disgusting.
The desserts were good, I guess because they were produced elsewhere consisting of squares and cake plus fresh fruit.

Our waitress was very attentive. The food was ok, nothing special. Drinks were well priced but there wasn’t anything exciting on the menu. Glad I tried it but probably don’t go back again as I can get tastier Indian food elsewhere.  Lets start with the drinks - the blurb on the website re wine pairing/ sommelier and ""gin trolley"" is a blatant lie. We ordered a drink off the menu that apparently wasn't available but weren't told until we asked as all others on the table had been served. That information should have been communicated and alternate options should have been offered - why wait for the guest to follow up on the order? We ordered gin sour, which was a 'specialty' cocktail - wouldn't recommend.
We ordered 4 starters - dahi puri had no flavor, raj kachori and fish were ok, lamb chops were delicious.
Coming to the mains, its a shame when a guests ask for salt and pepper that too at an Indian restaurant with the word 'spice' in their name. Even then the salt shaker that was brought in was empty. The bhuna ghost and fish curry were good but the daal and chicken korma were almost inedible.

Highly recommended and we will definitely return!  Very nice experience with family. Good tasting food with warm plates  Food was good but the service was poor.  Had to flag someone down everytime we wanted to order a drink, appetizer, main, dessert and asking for the bill.  Too bad the restaurant quality is so poor.  All the catered events by Maharaja have been excellent.  We have been regular customers of maharaja and it has been outstanding experience until this time . The appetizers were not sizzling hot . They were kind of warm . Service was quite poor . May be they were short staffed . After complaining midway our big feast the main course improved. Please don’t take reviews as poor ones as I am just trying to draw attention towards consistency which is the key every restaurant’s long term success . We will definitely continue to go there .

Simran was the main server for our table of 9 for Mother's Day. She was patient and answered all our questions. Ambience was as majestic as the pictures and food was perfect. I believe Maharaja had catering/buffet for at least a decade where there takeout location is now, so you know it was going to be good.

It was a Sunday brunch, very excellent value for your dollar although the kitchen over cooked my poached eggs. ￼Mikayla is always on point & very good! I think the night shift needs to pay more attention to the Restrooms because they are quite the mess in the morning, sticky floors, etc. all in all very excellent.￼  Sunday Brunch with family very reasonable and Mimosa priced accordingly.

It will be a long time before I return.  Service is always great, Mckayla is fantastic, always with a smile and great!  Server was super friendly and attentive to us.

I also loved how the waiter was patient and how he was able to be organized and calm.

It was a 1 hour wait before our meal was served.  The food served at tables is excellent.  The buffet food served at all gatherings I’ve been to Katelyn has been less than acceptable  Great food, excellent service and lovely setting.  Only the French fries were disappointing. Everything else was great.  Wonderful ambience, fantastic service & Seafood Chowder was delicious. My friends had Halibut & Beef Dip, which they said was good, but they weren’t raving about it. There was a good deal on a bottle of wine on a Tuesday evening.  I wouldn't recommend the nachos - they were poor.  Though fellow diners had the hamburger and it was very good.  We have been to this restaurant several times in the past three years, returning because the service has been very good, the menu selection quite extensive, the food preparation and presentation consistently excellent, and we always felt we were getting good value for fair prices.

Our visit three days ago will likely be our last.  The menu has been significantly reduced and even some items on the smaller menu were not available.  It wasn't that they were sold out, but were explained as a mistake on the menu.  Two of the food items we did choose were disappointing.  The coq au vin consisted of three small drumsticks, some quite thick sauce and over cooked potato chunks - it wasn't the stew I expected.  The Reuben was dried out, perhaps because it spent too much time on the grill, and the amount of smoked beef filling was ""sparse"".    To accompany the smaller menu, prices have understandably increased.  Our server was inexperienced, but then again, staff availability and competency seem to have become a common problem in the industry.

It almost seems as if the Arbutus Ridge Golf Club wishes its facility to move away from providing a good restaurant experience (good food, good service, fair pricing in a spectacular location) to become a mediocre experience (still in a spectacular location).  Perhaps I expect too much.  After all, the eating area's name is Satellite Bar and Grille so I should realistically expect bar and grill(e) food, but the rub is that there are a number of pubs with spectacular views in the Cowichan Valley that have great food and service for reasonable prices.   We'll now go there. Read more We were very pleased with the meal and the service. We had not been to this restaurant for a year because of disappointment with the last experience so were very pleased to see the improvements. We will definitely go back.  Would recommend, party of 10, everyone very satisfied with their dinners  This review is for breakfast today, February 25, 2024.  

We all know that the cost of living has increased over the past years and we do understand that with increased costs as well as wages, the price on restaurant meals will have to increase.  But....when you increase your price and then reduce what is on the plate that was there before... to find out now, that breakfast is served with only 1 piece of toast...and that extra piece will now cost.  

You really begin to feel that you are being nicked and dimed. 

There will be price point where consumers will reconsider their options for dining out.  

We have always enjoyed going to the Satellite Bar & Grill for dinner and for breakfast.  However, we will now think twice about going there for breakfast again.  There are other restaurant alternatives with better prices and food choices. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/26373854.webp
