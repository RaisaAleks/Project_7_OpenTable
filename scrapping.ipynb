Carluccio’s is a shadow of its former gastronomic self, sadly, with both the menu and the quality of the food much diminished since its pre-pandemic peak.  On the day of our visit, more than half the dessert menu was unavailable - indeed, many of the unavailable items had been crossed off the menu with a pen, which suggests ongoing problems.  But the staff are friendly, and it’s still the best restaurant in Piccadilly station. Read more Food was much better than I expected. Lovely seared tuna on the salad and my client had a very nice seafood risotto.  It is a nice place to take a break and eat at the train station, definitely not for a date. Prices are reasonable  Carluccio's is the perfect place to meet when people are travelling by train from different directions, just get off the train - straight into Carluccio's!  A very attractive area with good food.  On arrival we were greeted by a pigeon, eventually followed by a staff member. There only seemed to be 2 staff members which meant that service wasn’t particularly quick or friendly. Bathrooms were out of order so had to use station facilities. Garlic bread was one of the worst I’ve ever had but the risotto and pasta were both quite tasty. Hadn’t realised that it was a station restaurant when I found it on trip advisor and booked. Probably ok for a quick pit stop between trains but not really what we were hoping for for a dinner pre concert. Read more We booked online a table for two for dinner at 6:45pm. I had a question but my phone calls in the two days before dinner were all unanswered. I messaged to the restaurant to enquire several hours before arrival but still no reply. Upon arrival 5 minutes before 6:45pm, the staff told us that the kitchen would close at 6:45pm and we had to rush to order otherwise we could not have any food for dinner. The tuna we ordered was not available. The seabass was not pan fried, probably deep fried ... Read more Booked for 6.15pm, arrived to be told they closed at 6pm.

Although the food was excellent I felt the service could have been better. \n",
      "A waiter asked me what food I wanted within 5 mins of being seated and came back twice again before telling him I had not had chance to read the menu and I would signal him when I was ready.

Will definitely go again  Surprised by the previous guests rating at 4.5 as I had to book an alternative place for lunch in the same area (our first option is closed for lunch Monday and Tuesday)  Sicilian NQ is a lovely little place. Great atmosphere and service, chilled vibes and best of all amazing food. We had a nice time thank you.  Great food really authentic, only downside no Mr Mount Etna available 😢 but will be back for afternoon tea  Really disappointed overall, the main thing I was annoyed about was that I was served tap water in an Aqua Panna bottle! (Also £4) The pasta I ordered was also awful it felt like I was eating ramen noodles, almost like a bland soup, the server was also very rude and far from pleasant. I will say however the pistachio Arancino was good  Lovely food and lovely place every time! We got the mushroom and truffle pasta and it was amazing. Got the cannolo for dessert and cannot recommend it enough, amazing!  The restaurant was over booked, the food was below standard (cold and uncooked parts of the main) and we were kicked off our table before we even had a chance to consider dessert. A real shame when the previous visit was so good! We won’t be rushing back.  The food was incredible, we had the sharing boards antipasti and then a variety of the pasta dishes. The food was fresh and warm. The service unfortunately was not that great. We had a table booked for 6:30pm and when we turned up we were told our table was not ready and we had to come back in 15 mins, as two people had been sat on the end of our reserved table. No drinks were offered and we weren't advised we could wait by the bar or on the outside tables. The service was very slow, we waited an hour and half for our food to arrive at the table. However I will forgive the slow service once seated as it was an extremely busy Saturday night and they seemed short staffed. I would eat here again but perhaps not on a Saturday evening. Read more Lovely place. Food was excellent and the staff were very attentive. Will definitely be going again soon. \n",

      "Page 1 Comments:  Food was amazing and the staff were wonderful, would definitely recommend on all accounts  Delicious food and pleasant atmosphere. The best affogato I've ever had. The servers recommend sharing plates but you won't want to give anything away, it's that good. I would like to see a bit more variety in the dishes with more vegetables as some of the creamier pastas are quite rich. Vegetarian options are quite limited due to the rennet used in several non-meat dishes. Read more Amazing food, best Italian food I have had in Manchester. Unique fresh and flavourful. Staff so lovely and helpful. Can’t wait to come back, thankyou!  Great evening. Good cocktails and the food was brilliant. Was a little rushed by the waiting staff to pay when we were still eating our desserts though which wasn’t great.  We visited Onda for our 1 year anniversary. The vibe in the restaurant is great, its not to loud or crowded even though it is very busy. We waited a long time for a food unfortunately due to a mistake with the order however the staff were very apologetic about this and gave us 50% off the bill and a free dessert! So cant complain.\n",

We got the hot wings. Came on a plate with some chives, on previous visits we got them in a skillet & nicer garnish. Pork rib &burger was lovely.

Only thing don’t appreciate 12.5 % service charge. Other than that lovely restaurant  and prices good value  Location- The location of the restaurant was in the Spinningfields/Deansgate area which is easily located and only a short walk from the station and Tram stop.\n",

      "Value: While the food itself was enjoyable it was not good value for money. Should have received more for the price charged.

The service was amazing, food was delicious and was overall a great experience would definitely come again.  Got the impression that bottomless brunch included food so was a bit shocked when I got the bill. I did ask one of the waitresses if the food was included in the price and she shrugged her shoulders and said I think so. When I realised it was just the drinks we continued to have drinks ordering two at a time as it took them a while to bring them. Then in the last half hour we were told that the manager has said we can only order one at a time. I had a hair on one of my drinks and also a cracked flute glass. Not the best for the amount of money spent. Sat very close together with other customers. Beautifully decorated though and food was good Read more\n",

Would definitely revisit if in Manchester again.  My friend and I visited Evelyn’s for brunch and had wonderful experience! After having waited half an hour from when we arrived for our booking, to asking someone to take our order (no one had even come and offered us drinks), we had excellent service from the waiter we asked to please come and take our order. He profusely apologised, and even bumped our order ahead - we received our drinks and food so quickly! Both food and drinks were delicious - and very good value for money. Best brunch dish I’ve had in a long time! The restaurant itself has gorgeous aesthetics, and a nice vibe in general. The first server who saw us when we arrived very kindly put our cases in the staff cupboard, which we really appreciated. Despite the initial delay with ordering, we couldn’t fault the rest of our visit, and would definitely recommend Evelyn’s to anyone!

      "Page 1 Comments:  Not much room between the tables, restaurant was busy. Food came pretty quick, presentation not fantastic.  Once we had finished they cleared some of the plates away but not all of them. Had refillable drinks, never once asked if we would like a refill. Had to ask for our bill 3 times.  Fantastic experience at Hard Rock Cafe in Manchester. Every member of staff wished my daughter a happy birthday. Shoutout to Taylor who looked after us throughout our meal.  The staff were excellent.. I think the food and drinks are over priced for what you get ..  Wow, what a meal! One of the best I’ve ever had. I had the Trio combo, it was cooked to perfection and super tasty, and at a reasonable price! My wife had the fajitas and they were outstanding too. Value for money is insane in my opinion!  Good as always service was great and timely. The music played was somewhat less rock than it used to be which was a shame but still good  The Swiss cheese and mushroom burger was the best burger I’ve had anywhere!

Great location with good menu and nice staff and atmosphere  Amazing food! Staff very good and overall lovely night thank you x  Great service, delicious food, busy restaurant with plenty of choice.  My son and I visited Piccolino for a Sunday lunch. We both fancied Spaghetti Carbonara so off we went - now I wish we hadn't. We were greeted by a friendly Italian woman on our arrival and so her Italian was a nice reminder of where we were and our many visits to Italy. From here on in, all the other staff threw out Italian words randomly, when really there was no need. The waiting staff were a little too fussy for our liking, e.g. within a mouthful of food 3 asked if we were enjoying our food. The Carbonara was a poor imitation and was barely warm, very fatty - even for guanciale - and it lack any flavour. In fact, so did the whole dish. \n",
