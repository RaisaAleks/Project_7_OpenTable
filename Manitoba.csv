I reminded the hostess that we had arrived and we quickly got the attention of our server. I think they made up for the lack of initial attention! No issues, and great service thereafter. Thanks!  Took a long time for the server to check in, including refilling water, and checking in on drinks. We ordered chips and guacamole, but we were only initially brought the guacamole. It took over 20 minutes for the server to bring us chips to go with our guacamole, but this was after our main dishes were brought out. By the end of the experience we were dissatisfied with the service, and the quality and small quantity of food did not overwhelm how poor the service was. Read more Great place to go before a concert event or Jets game.  Happy hour prices are very good value.  Service was friendly and always kept my glass topped up.  I would definitely recommend people try this restaurant!  Waitress was nice but forgot our drinks multiple times bright wrong drinks multiple times and left us unattended for long periods of time.  Didn’t even check to see if our food was good, forgot to bring more taco chips for the leftover guacamole
Likely won’t go back anytime soon.  Service was great very punctual and food was very good. I would’ve preferred it just a little bit spicier.

The only drawback were we had a table next to us that had a few drinks and we’re extremely loud. But nothing we could do about that. Read more Our server Taylor was so friendly and knowledgeable!  Poorest excuse for enchiladas I've ever seen -  flour tortillas thrown on a plate, undetectable chicken and everything drowned in cheap cheese. Really, fllour tortillas in an enchilada (!!) - at those prices you would think they could afford corn. Yech.

Everything else was just mediocre - except fot the guacamole which was good. Read more This was our first time there, everything went very well. The service was well timed, and the food was excellent . The selection of drinks was very good and an extra bonus was the margaritas glass was half rimmed with salt, so you had good control of how much with each sip. The only critique would be that there was no host and they definitely needed one tonight. The wait staff were taking turns covering, but it was very hard for them to keep up. Read more The service was fast and friendly. The food was amazing! This is my second time visiting and will definitely be back. Good value for your dollar!  I've tasted authentic Mexican food in my life and this is as authentic as it can get. Delicious food. The experience was great.

Delicious Food, great ambience and great service.  GREAT FOOD AND GREAT SERVICE THE DINNER ROOM WAS NOT TO NOISEY WILL BE BACK  Great service but unfortunately the steaks were undercooked and had to be sent back twice to a get a medium well, by the time we finally got our food the others had already finished their meals.

Everything was good as far as the host, server, restaurant and atmosphere.

It's was disappointing for the meal but a good time otherwise. Read more The restaurant was busy but the food and service was great! We were able to have a conversation without having to yell so although it was busy the noise level was reasonable!  Amazing experience, service was outstanding, food was delicious.  Made a reservation and was taken in right away with no waiting.  Restaurant was very busy but we were treated like the only people there.  Would highly recommend.  It has been a while since we’ve been to CHOP, so we were pleasantly surprised to see a bit of a revamp to the menu.  Starting off with a cocktail, I ordered the chop Mule which was absolutely fantastic!  So refreshing.  Then we ordered the Nashville Chicken Wings and the Steak Bites.  Both were delicious.  Highly recommend!  I ordered the featured soup, Prime Rib Mushroom.  It was very tasty, but not hot enough for my liking.  I also ordered the Loaded Mashed Potatoes.  Again, very tasty but could be hotter.  My husband ordered the Centre Cut New York Steak which was cooked to perfection.  My daughter enjoyed the half rack of Baby Back Ribs, and my son had the chop Burger.  All 3 were very satisfied with their meals.  The food was top notch and the service was too.  Our server was friendly, polite, and attentive.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu, answering questions and making recommendations with ease.  Overall, this was a great dining experience, and we are already looking forward to our next visit! Read more Great tasting food and nice service.  Highly recommend Chop.  Great food and great service. Even wrote happy birthday on my dessert.  Onion soup, spring rolls, seafood pasta and a burger and fries. All were ok.  The food was excellent taste and appearance.

For reservations of parties of 13 guests or more, please call the venue directly. We kindly request our guests refrain from making multiple reservations for a single large party. While we will do our best to accommodate large groups, we cannot guarantee multiple reservations will be seated together.","Read more Had a party reserved for 16 there on Saturday, Oct 5. 14 people showed up. Our server was really nice. The food was mediocre for price. I had the rec room burger and it tasted plain. I had to put ketchup on it. Fries were really good. Our friend had steak and upgraded to cesar. It was the smallest upgrade I’ve ever seen. For a $40 plate, it looked pathetic. Service was soooo slow. Our reservation was at 7:15 and we didn’t get bills until almost 9:30pm. I asked for a water twice and never got it. Read more The experience was disappointing. We were celebrating two birthdays. When guest arrived to the reservation a few minutes before 5 they were told the server wouldn’t be there until after 5. Our table had been seated fully shortly after 5. By 5:15 no one had arrived at our table to address us and we had to ask to have someone come by to get waters or drinks started. We were later told our server started at 5 which was why we didn’t have anyone approach earlier. Having the delay wouldn’t have been a concern had we not watched multiple people who were dressed as management and state they were from the management team standing around and talking casually for extended periods. The perception of the serving staff rushing around and the management team not contributing was consistent throughout the evening. Our server was lovely, very kind, but you could tell he was rushed to serve multiple tables quickly. When management approached to ask about the evening, they were dismissive of the concerns that while our server was lovely, it would have been helpful to have someone approach the table prior to 20 minutes after our reservation. If the guest are observing the amount of effort the serving staff are doing and the amount the management staff are having side conversations, there is an efficiency concern. Read more The service in the restaurant was really good. We each had a burger with fries after the crispy mushroom appy. The hamburger was really good, juicy, tasty! The Chicken burger was ok. It was rather plain. The slice of tomato looked like they use cherry tomatoes based on the size. Not really what I’d serve on a fairly large burger. The manager did come over and gave us $10 towards gaming, since we bought $100 game tag along with dinner.
However, even though we got scene points for dinner, the 1000 bonus scene points for buying the $100 game tag never got added to my account. I called but was told that I’d have to wait at least two days and then take it up with Scene.
Outside of those two items, we had a good evening. Read more Everything was great. We really enjoyed the visit.  Food was great, reasonably priced and the service was excellent  It’s convenient to dine here before/after playing games. The food has gotten much better than a few years ago even though it’s still pricey. $10 for a small dessert is crazy to me. Service was good though, and overall 7.5/10!  The food we had was amazing. I had a delicious mushroom pizza and my aunt had the watermelon salad and my husband had a burger and my kids had the chicken tenders and fries. Everyone said they really enjoyed the food but the pizza I had was specifically noteworthy. So good. The gaming was fun as always and the server was very friendly and efficient. Will come back again. Read more We had a wonderful experience. It was our son's birthday celebration and the staff were attentive from the beginning to the end. Our waitress, Alyssa, was exceptional: very friendly, considerate, and efficient.
We will definitely return.
Thank you! Read more 30 minute wait for a table, understandable on ""all you can eat"" wing night. After being seated, over an hour wait until food arrived. The first order of wings took over 30 minutes to be delivered, only started timing after I had noticed it was taking a while so I don't know exactly how long the first order took. Second order of wings took 38 minutes and at this time we were told a third order would take over 45 minutes. We declined and opted to leave instead. The wings themselves were good but there is only four flavours to choose from. I would much rather go to Smitty's for wing night, many more flavours to choose from and very prompt service. Will not be back for wing night here. Read more The food was good, once we got it. We visited for All You Can Eat Wings, but the service was incredibly slow. We'd hoped to get 3-4 baskets of wings each, but after 2.5 hrs, we had still only been served our second basket, so we ended up leaving. We didn't really have a dedicated server, as 3-4 different people came to take our orders, and we ended up having to order our drinks twice before they actually came. Our first order of wings didn't come out for over an hour, and even then, it was only for two members of our party. Upon the rest of the wings arriving, we immediately ordered more, but even once everyone had finished our first set of wings, we ended up waiting another hr before the second round came. we decided at that point it wasn't worth waiting for another round, and just asked for our bills. after waiting another half hour, the bills finally came and had a bunch of errors. we got our second round of corrected bills another 15 later, and paid. The special also came with some gaming credit, and ended up having to chase the server back down to get that, but they weren't able to add the credit to our existing accounts and had to get new accounts with a small amount of credits and had to run around with two seperate wristbands on. The gaming afterward was great, but I don't think I'll be returning for food any time soon. Read more Always a great place that’s accommodating of large groups.

When I go there I usually get the bruschetta as I love the varied flavours. Small note: this time there was barely any ricotta (it was spread thin like butter) which made the fig ones quite dry. Rest was delicious as per usual (and no I didn’t mention it as it was a business meeting with out of towners.) Everyone ordered something different and they all enjoyed. Very energetic in there so expect high noise level.

Love the ambiance and a diverse menu but not overwhelmed by  too many choices. We will return.  I've had many 5 star dinners here - this just wasn't it. The produce let down the bruschetta (fridge-y tasting apple, flavorless tomatoes). They were so kind to make the blueberry mule into a mocktail, but mine was loaded with berry bits/seeds.

It was a little crowded i found. Tables too close together and music a little loud.  Amazing vibe, and incredible food!!

This is a great addition to Winnipeg’s food scene—gorgeous atmosphere, incredible food, wonderful staff!!! Tell the world!!!  Finally, fine dining returns to the Fort Garry Hotel in the shape of Vida. White tablecloths, an acceptable wine list and some exceptional dishes. Besting the Oval Room which has become a haven for loud, cap-wearing diners.  It is a lovely place to have dinner - regardless of occasion. Everything really is perfect. We may have had an inexperienced server which impacted our experience but I've eater there before and had outstanding service.  Absolutely beautiful Winnipeg Gem at the Hotel Fort Garry!  This restaurant is gorgeous and I loved all the details even down to the high quality glassware.  I was pleasantly surprised by the menu, and The food was absolutely delicious!  Highly recommend!!!  Food was wonderful and service was excellent. A lovely evening all round.  Food was fantastic! Our waiter, Rusland, made great recommendations for the food and we loved everything!
Definitely will be returning here  Service was great, attentive without being intrusive.
The restaurant is nicely decorated.
The food was good but overpriced in general.
I would return to try it again. Read more The venue was amazing but the food left much to be desired. First course was so salty it was inedible. The 2 pasta dishes were lukewarm at best and pretty taste less. The dessert was amazing as well as my margarita but sadly we will not be returning.  Perhaps the best dining experience that we’ve had in Winnipeg. Two of us shared five delicious items off of the menu with a fine bottle of wine recommended by the sommelier based on our desires. We also shared a desert with our coffees. The quality of service and presentation of the food items equaled the care that went into preparing each item. The ambiance is inviting and we were not rushed at all. Can barely wait to return. Read more  The food and service quality was truly exceptional, looking forward to my next visit.  Highly recommend!!  Great service, great food, great experience, great ambience!  We had a very lovely dinner here. The food was delicious and the service was exceptional. Would definitely recommend it.  Delicious food. Attentive and very knowledgeable serving staff. Highly recommend for a special occasion or night out.  Well curated service and experience in one of Winnipeg’s classic hotels. Hospitality and classic service with a great Sommelier-Daniel, who recommended a fine Cavali.
Started with the antipasto along with the calamari followed by a Classic Burrata and tomato dish. Taste was classic and the freshness and quality ingredients were evident.

Seared black cod with puttanesca and meat ragu lasagna with bechamel were both great and substantial as mains.
I would certainly recommend for a special night out or celebration, or any day if you are okay spending a few dollars…Italian fine dining Read more The overall dining experience at Vida was excellent. From the moment we arrived until we left every person we interacted with was professional, helpful and friendly. I recommend the calamari and shrimp appetizer. It was outstanding. We asked the sommelier to pick wines for us based on our order and they paired beautifully. Definitely will be going back.  Delicious Italian food in a beautiful environment.  I highly recommend this restaurant. You should try the ARANCINI SICILIANI al BURRO and the CARPACCIO di SPIGOLA su PANZANELLA ROMANA, as they are my favorite dishes.  The food was great. Thanks to Brian for helping guide through our meal choices and Daniel for the great choices pairing our wine.

An excellent well paced dining experience

Thanks Vida Read more If you are looking for a authentic Italian dinning experience book a table at Vida Cucina Italia.
Outstanding dishes that leave you extremely satisfied.
Words cannot describe how amazing the meals are at Vida Cucina Italia.   The recommended seafood salad antipasto was a little underwhelming. I would not have ordered if I'd known. The wine chosen was excellent. My wild boar dish was very tasty although the meat quite chewy. Everything else was as hoped and expected for a thank you meal for our hosts before we head of back to the UK on Wednesday.  Great food and service . Can’t wait to come back again . Thank you  Very upscale feel yet really chill and cozy. Perfect date night spot. The in house sommelier is a nice touch and ready with recommendations and pairings. Food was delicious, service was professional to a letter. Cheers  Thank you for making my parents 61 wedding anniversary special with not only the service, attention to detail, but the extra touches by our server and the kitchen (writing happy anniversary on my parents’ dessert 💓). Our server, Patrica (sorry if I forgot the name!!) was AMAZING and so very personal, witty and knowledgeable. Thank you for a wonderful evening celebrating love!

The first outpost of local favourite Pizzeria Gusto, Gusto North is an extension of the flavours and feeling of being at an Italian family dinner table. Inspired by its original location on Academy Road, the Gusto team have brought a meticulously designed original menu and space to Hargrave St. Market's only full service sit down restaurant. Visit, and you’ll feel right at home in the heart of downtown.","Amazing meal and wonderful service in a beautiful atmosphere!  We had a salad that was uninspired and over priced. The gluten free pizza was sparse on the toppings  and the crust was pre-made and cakey. Loved the beef tartare, the only real winner. Drinks were outrageously over priced. Gusto was once the place to go before a game not anymore.  We were greeted promptly at the door and the staff was friendly. It took almost 20 minutes to get a round of vodka martinis with no communication from our server as to why. She did not stop by to let us know the issue and therefor it also took 25 minutes before our order was taken. We did, however, have our water replenished several times in that time, lol. Maybe an extra bartender and one less busser on a Saturday night would have been a better choice. Food was mediocre. It is definitely more elevated at Pizzeria Gusto. I’m not sure if there was a manager working as we could not see anyone who fit the mark. It definitely seemed like the young staff needed more guidance. Read more The food is amazing. The manager is very nice and helpful when things aren't going well. It's very disorganized and I'm not sure who does the training, but I feel it's none existent. The servers helping us were floundering the whole time and barely had a clue as to what was going on. I was very hungry when I got there so I ordered my appy right away. I told them twice I didn't receive it and then got it with my meal. It definitely wasn't what we had hoped for. Read more The server changed three times and they rarely seemed to come around. Food was very average compared to previous visits to this restaurant. Cocktails were great, though. Noise level was high, but to be expected given the pre hockey crowd.  Delicious pasta! Sat at the bar and fun watching the engaged staff mix drinks, cook, excellent service!  Lack of hospitality. The whole experience was bizarre.  Food was very good. Very noisy. Service was good though sometimes a little inattentive. Very friendly staff. Restaurant is a little hard to locate on second floor of urban plaza.  Food was good. Service appropriately attentive. Arancini was very good. Lobster dish was just ok.
Great for large groups.  Arrival Checking in was poor. Didn't know the table I reserved was already partial occupied by some of my guests. Service looked new and were disorganized. Too long to place a drink order and then the same result for food order. Asked for well-done pizza and 5 minutes later a waiter asked me to confirm the particular pizza. When it did arrive, It did not come well done as requested Read more  The first table we were given was extremely wobbly, causing drinks to spill. So we moved to another table. I ordered an Aperol spritz and they didn’t have aperol even though there is a liquor store next door and it was still open. There were some very loud and disruptive noises sounding like construction and really killed the atmosphere. The ricotta was a very delicious appetizer. Unfortunately our pasta dish was on the cold side. Somewhat disappointing in general. One good thing about the whole experience was our server Benaise, she was sweet and delightful and attentive. I think Gusto North is probably a really good restaurant but maybe I went there on the wrong night. Read more First time here. Hidden gem in Winnipeg. Great vibe  Emily was a wonderful waitress and helped us the whole evening! The noise with a large table beside us made it very difficult to hear each other speak. More vegan options please. Thank you!  My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and sat on the rooftop patio, we were pretty much the only people dining! Food was great, waiter was great, would def go back!  Food was great. It wasn’t busy, so the volume was good, service was timely. Everything was great!  Food was great!  Service also great. Definitely coming back.  Overall a pleasant night.  Good as expected. Service prompt and pleasant.  The overall appearance of the patio left a lot to be desired. Nice flowers along one side.  However tables and chairs were all crooked. Sofas  tucked away and cushions piled up high. Could at least make the effort to have it more set up even though there were only 6 tables being used.  
Would have made the patio more attractive . Read more Food was great as always, maybe because it’s not busy inside, hardly to find our server for advance service. 
And without checking whether we finish the foods or not, the server just took the plates away.  Good food. Upscale open dining. Clean and newer. 1  The staff greeted us warmly and were attentive throughout the sitting.  Food quality, and taste was excellent.  Very creative dishes and we enjoyed them very much!!!  Thank you.   Fantastic food, attentive server and intimate setting.  I’ve dined here quite a bit, love the location and the food, it’s always great and I’ve never had a meal I didn’t truly enjoy.

Going there during a weeknight when it’s less busy is a much better experience because I find the table are pretty crammed and the acoustics aren’t that great. It gets pretty loud on a busy night.

The service is okay, this is the second time in a couple weeks where I’ve noticed something that irks me. They will wait until you finish your first drink and order your second before the food comes to your table. Coincidence?

All in all I recommend this restaurant, but a few changes would be welcome. Read more Reservations made easily via Open Table are always a plus! We were greeted by a very energetic young lady and seated in a timely matter. Our server Sam was good, having both tables inside and out. Thinking sections could be managed better. What I found interesting was there was no floor manager. 2 servers and a bartender. The food was delicious as were the zero proof cocktails. A nice touch dessert was served with a candle... birthday at the table. Best part no embarrassing singing pet peeve of mine. Differently would return. The staff were warm and engaging and the food was delicious. Read more Great food and service ! Thank you chicken dish was really different and very flavourful  Overall everything was good, kids had a good experience with their friends for her birthday  dinner. Good times great memories.  The food was very good but portions quite small.  We had to ask for more bread for our apps which our waitress brought without any hesitation.  The food was quite expensive for the portions.  It was also quite noisy and they kept playing with the lights (light, dark, etc.).  My pasta meal was more like a soup and contained very little seafood; the lobster portion was cut in half which seemed a little bit of a rip off.  I know it is difficult to make a go of it these days but, at those prices, we may have to eat out a little less! Read more Great pizza, great atmosphere, great service!  Highly recommend Gusto North!  We opted to share 3 pizzas, the beef short rib was not very good at all. Asking for a bit of coke to the rye and coke drink that we had already ordered...that seemed ro create a fuss.  Consistently great food!  I love the soup and salad for lunch!

First time to this restaurant.  The service and food was excellent.  Would go there again!  Love the empanadas! Fantastic food and great atmosphere.  Great food and service. Definitely our go-to place for pizza in Winnipeg. The gluten free option is one of best I’ve had anywhere.  Waited quite a while to get the bill after we finished desserts   Holey Smokes was delicious. Steve B was surprisingly good. Peanut butter on a pizza was a bit hard to imagine, but it did taste good! Pizzas are large and easily sharable. The Choribun was also very good.  The historic building was interesting and the pictures are worth a look. Our server was knowledgeable about the building and the pictures and provided interesting information. It was extremely noisy when we arrived but once 2 large groups left, it was quite pleasant. 
Thank you for a tasty and interesting lunch! Read more The food and service were great but the move level made it hard to talk at our table  I’ve been here a few times in the past and always enjoyed each visit. I recently visited on a Saturday evening with the best friend and my dog on the pet-friendly patio. Staff were very friendly and inviting, even providing water for my dog. They also happily answered all the questions we had about the menu.

We ended up ordering the Chivito pizza which was meaty, delicious and filling. For drinks, we ordered the Corrientes Spritzers which were light, delicious and refreshing.

I look forward to returning! Read more Corrientes never disappoints, love the patio during summer months.  The bruschetta appetizer was excellent and I would order it again!  We went for the first time with our monthly Dinner Club.  Food and staff were both excellent!  Everyone had a different pizza (so many options, it was hard to choose).  Appetizers and desserts were also excellent.  Really enjoyed talking to the owners as well!  Me and my husband just love going there!, the empanadas are sooo good! And the atmosphere is great!  Everything was amazing!! It’s a great place to enjoy amazing food and good vibes. The staff is friendly and ready to help quickly  Outstanding service! Best cauliflower fritters I've ever had and the perfect date night start.

Although we were at a very tiny table and against a brick wall, the server, food, and ambience was great. We had lamb and chicken empanadas and the Italian bruschetta! All was good! Wear the napkin as the bruschetta was piled high with deliciousness and I did wear some of the lovely cherry tomatoes - a small price to pay for such wonderful flavours! We will be back!

We visit this restaurant many times.  Great vibe and consistently good food and service!  Service was great, however my mom and I were up sick all night. This has never happened before. Hoping it’s just a one off experience.  The pulled chicken clubhouse was very expensive for what you get.  There was barely any chicken on the sandwich.  The fries were also minimal.   Poor value for the price.  Professional, courteous staff.
Beautiful decor with high standing windows.
Vibrant ambience, vibe and music.
Pristine centered location with free underground parking. Read more our waiter wasn’t catering to us whatsoever. Didn’t ask us how our food was, didn’t refill our water at all. The food was good but there was no catering towards us. She would only come to our table if we needed questions answered or just a simple water refill. The only one who was there most of the time was the busser who had asked us how we wanted our steak to be made. Not one time did our waitress go up to our table to ask how the food was and if we needed anything else. Read more Greeted with absolutely attention and escorted to our seats. Dom(Dominique) was absolutely killed it customer service five star  for her and manager Alladin was excellent and lovely lady she did not introduce herself. Food was excellent as expected but a little too salty on chicken wings and steak on seasonings. But definitely would go back.  I booked a reservation at Earls on Main days in advance for a dual celebration—a going-away dinner for my aunt and a birthday dinner for my dad. While I understand that Saturdays can be busy, the evening quickly turned sour due to poor communication and unprofessional management.

We had a 5 PM reservation, and while the dinner was decent, just as we were being served our third round of drinks around 6:50 PM, a manager approached us and told us we needed to vacate the table by 7 PM. At no point during the booking process, or when we arrived (in staggered groups), were we informed of a time limit. Each of us entered at different times, and none of us were told about this rule.

When we brought this up to the manager, her response was that she ""apologized no one told us, but they had people waiting for the table."" Our server even apologized for how this was being handled and said we could take our time. However, not long after, a different manager came over, repeating that we needed to leave, with zero effort to offer a solution or make the situation better.

What really frustrated us was when, after being told multiple times to leave, we waited for 10 minutes, only to have the same rude manager return and say they had ""found another table"" for us. Why didn’t they tell us this right away instead of letting the situation escalate and ruin our mood? This could’ve been handled so much better.

In the end, we had them comp our last round of drinks and left to continue our celebration elsewhere. What started as a nice evening turned into an unprofessional, frustrating experience that put a damper on a special occasion. We won’t be returning to Earls on Main. Read more We liked the food, the service and free dessert, but we didn't like the fact that we reserved a table for our birthday party and when we came in we were told that we have only limited time to be there. It has never been like this before. It really disappointed us.  The food was great! The vibe was great! It was difficult to get our servers attention, however. She was often not seen to request more water, soya sauce for the table, to order more drinks and more food when another patron joined our table. And then again, it was a wait to find our waitress to get our bills at the end of our evening. We had to bothered other staff to request these things and we felt like an annoyance. Read more Read more Despite our having reservations, we still had to wait quite a while. After I watched the hostess seat four other parties, I finally asked if there was a problem; I reminded her that she told us to wait for￼ a minute. She had completely forgotten about us, even though I had spoken directly to her and she checked my name Into the system. She saw a table in the distance and offered it to us. When we got there, yep, there was a placard with my name on it. Read more It has a very comfortable vibe, the steak tortellini is fantastic and the cocktails are refreshing and delicious.  One server on for lunch, never got water refill, mixed my coffee with my fork. Not happy serving staff. First time I saw this at Earls. Food was amazing as always  Wow! What can I say? Earl’s main has become such a pillar in our community! I can’t say enough good things from the service to the ambience, they never fail to knock it out of the park! The seafood tower is the height of luxury, the hosts are queens and the staff continue to slay the day. Will definitely be back! 10/10!!!  Vibes at this location were immaculate. I think the loudness did affect our server. It was hard to get her attention and had us not want to order things like dessert and drinks bc of how long in between.  I want to begin with saying that we had a wonderful server and the food was great as always so we were very happy with the actual meal.
What we were not happy with was being told  immediately, before we even sat down, that we would have a  time limit of 1 hour 45 mins to eat our meal. When I questioned  that, as we had made our reservation on open table and knew nothing about this the hostess had told the manager and we were informed that we could have 2 hours. This whole discussion put a damper on our visit and we will think twice before going this location. Read more The food was amazing! We had 7 people in our party and everyone loved their meals! Annabelle and Meresha were awesome servers! I have always loved the ambiance of the restaurant! This is definitely on my top three places to dine!!!  We had 2 drinks each and we only got their truffle fries to share. 
They were really good, perfectly cooked.
We loved our drinks as well but they are a bit pricey for what you get. 
All in all we do love it there and recommend trying it. Read more Server was inattentive, 3 crispy prawn tacos were brought to my friend when she only ordered one. The server that brought out the food put all 3 on the table after we told him this, he came back 2 minutes later and took the 2 extra tacos. As a server I would never put food on the table and leave it sitting with the customer then take it back.
The server was inattentive and never checked on us, when she did our drinks took 20 minutes. We would have had another 1-2 rounds if the server checked on us with while we were sitting there with empty drinks.
Usually I have a great experience at Earl’s however I am not understanding what happened this evening. Read more Great service as always. The Hunan Kung Pow was excellent, as were the Old Fashions to wash it down  Read more We’ve always enjoyed going to Earls 300 Main for brunch, but today was a major disappointment. The service was bad, and the food was far below their usual standard. The bacon was overdone and the potato pavé was almost burnt. When we sent the bacon back, we were surprised to see it still charged on our bill. This experience really fell short of what we’ve come to expect from Earls. I hope they can address these issues, as it used to be a favorite spot. Read more Food was excellent and while service was good felt we were being rushed to eat and leave.  Volume level of music was excessive - barely able to talk.  Will think twice about going back for that reason alone.  We had a wonderful experience with our family group at Earls!  The food was delicious and service was efficient.

The steak & sushi was a highlight.  The ponzu sauce surrounding the steak was especially delicious.

The music and the restaurant was lovely however a little loud to speak over at a table for seven Read more Loved the customer service and food. We will be  back again  Great service, ambience, food was good. Our server handled a group of 14 very well.  Very impressed with the new location of Earls.  Great ambiance.  We sat on the patio and it was nice, although you can hear the traffic and ambulance, but that is to be expected given the location.  Would definitely recommend the Seafood tower and spinach and cheese dip.  Our server was also great and attentative.  Only thing I can think of which can be improved are the hosts/greeters.  They were not too energetic or wecloming, which is unforunate given they are the first point of interactions for the restaurant.  Just a little more enthusiasm would have been nice, or at least match the energy of the waiters/waitresses. Read more Everyone is so nice and the vibes are always right.

Me and my friend come here often. I highly recommend.  Took my fiancé here for his birthday dinner. In my initial OpenTable booking request, I selected the dining room, but upon arrival I was informed they were seating us in the lounge. We started off here but found it far too noisy/ less intimate (hence why I had initially opted for the dining room). Fortunately, they were able to move some things around to accommodate us in the dining room, which was much better!  Once here, our server was energetic, attentive, and an overall gem. The food was also quite good - I had the fettuccini Alfredo with Cajun chicken, as I’ve had many times before. My only complaint was the pasta seemed a little over-cooked/ less “al dente” than it usually is, but it was still tasty. My fiancé loved his steak & sushi.

Incredible food . We had a sometimes fussy 14 year old with us and she loved it. Would eat there again in a heartbeat.  Service was amazing as always! Go on Wednesdays for $1 oysters - very fresh and delious! It can get a bit loud with the open concept, but overall, a lovely restaurant to dine with frineds and family.  Lovely restaurant in a heritage building. Excellent food and service. Will definitely dine there again.  Never disappoints: a classy - yet casual - evening, every time, with food of the highest quality, tasty and presentation. Enjoy!  The service was well paced and our server was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.  The food, as always, was delicious.  The charcuterie board is always a great combination of meats and pates and the house made pickles were sour and a great compliment to the rich liver mousse.  The coconut caramel with the carrot cake was so good we wanted to lick the plate.  We look forward to our next visit. Read more We love this restaurant so much and try to visit every time we are in Winnipeg. The food and service are always terrific. I’ve never had a bad experience here and this visit was no exception. Thank you Peasant Cookery.  Excellent food, service was great as well. The food reminds me of upscale homemade meals which was so good. I had the split pea soup and the tourtiere and it was incredible.   Good place in Winnipeg. Oysters were tasty and fresh, beef carpaccio also was delicious. However, there is a vent there that turns on every 10-15 minutes and is very loud. But I can recommend this place and definitely will come back.  As always an excellent experience. Buck a shuck Wednesday is always a hit.  Went for the 'Buck a Shuck' Wednesday, ordered 3 appies and a few drinks to round it out. Food and service were amazing - will definitely be going back.  Took a while to have our order taken, but in the end was quite friendly and we lingered a nice atmosphere was created. Shrinkflation is real - the tourtière was really small. For $28 it was ludicrously small. I left and ate some cereal at home.  The Peasant Cookery was great. the service was great and we had the cheese plate which was delicious. 
I just wish there were more vegetarian options.  We went to Peasant Cookery to celebrate our birthdays. The restaurant was quiet, the service prompt and professional. The food was very good!  Great ambience  but unfortunately not a great food experience .   My dining partner enjoyed the flatbread however the pickeral sandwich very dry and tough.  While the food was good (huge portions of fries to accompany the mussels, excellent pate and a delicious gravy on the steak frites), the service was fair at best. When my friends arrived they waited more than 10 minutes to get water and a cocktail - the manager came and said it was because there was confusion over who had which section. The server was slightly erratic in his timings, didn't tell us about any specials or the mussel flavour of the day until we asked and made some odd comments (he said he would stand there awkwardly to watch me eat my least bite so he could take my plate, and then did!). It certainly wasn't up to our usual experience at this place, but won't stop us from coming back. Read more Peasant Cookery is consistently excellent. The flatbreads, salads, and entrees were all delicious.  Great food but crazy long waits. 2.5 hours for dinner for 2 people   Great downtown experience on the patio with great dining choices and quality food  The food was phenomenal but the server barely spoke and kept forgetting to put in our drink orders.  Great vibe, awesome service, excellent food. Our server was really excellent. Thanks.  House Sausage Meatball Pappardelle was delicious, as well as the cheese board.  Great food, service, and atmosphere! This is one of my favourite restaurants in Winnipeg.  Fantastic shrimp penne! The cream sauce was great!  We had the HUNTER’S CHICKEN and LAKESHORE PICKEREL, both which were very good.  What was surprisingly exceptional was the CHICKEN LIVERS.
I would not have ordered them, but my wife did and I was happy she did.  Service was kind of slow. Waiters and Waitresses were not around as much as they should be to make sure everything was satisfactory and checking up whether you needed anything else.  We enjoyed our gathering there, but the food and service was mediocre. PC had been the place to be in the past. The quality of food and ambience could use a refresh. But thanks anyway.  We were curious to try the restaurant but were disappointed.  It's a great location for the Concert Hall and RMTC - however, the food was only mediocre, portions were fair but service was slow to start.  We four sat for almost 15 minutes before we had any attention - and only after we asked!  While it's suggested 'smart casual' - with the tears in the upholstery on the chairs, you may be taking a chance!  Sorry - but we won't be back.

Great place for a tasty lunch or dinner. Lots of parking in front and out back.  The best dinner I have ever had there.
Portion size was impressive
Food was very tasty.   Noise level due to music level and choice totally took away from the experiece. It was diffcult to even speak to one another in our booth .  This may be more acceptable in a bar but certainly not in a dining room. It was not poddible to get the attention of a waiter ti lower the volume.  We will not likely return to the dining room.
We would recommend the food, not the dining room due to noise level . Read more Great selection of good food at reasonable prices. This has become my go to place for lunch dates with friends as they don’t mind if you visit awhile. Good place for larger groups too.  First time going to that location.  Will definitely go back.  Server was a little slow. But the food was great.  I usually have the Greek pizza, which is outstanding. The chicken club was very dry and plain. May have been a one off.  Service was great, kept gluten free food separate from other orders.  Food was quick and as we ordered%  They have the best gluten free pizza in the city. I have tried a lot and there’s is the best. The chicken souvlaki is also really good.  Excellent service! Staff was polite, respectful and focused on details.Food was exquisite and tasty. Restaurant very clean with a friendly ambiance.  Great service, good vibes. food could be better … was very disappointed in the quality of the food. for a place known for their pizza it could’ve atleast tasted like pizza  Awesome as usual !

Great place for a date or friends! You need to go, Won’t disappoint.  On a very quiet Monday night, there were a lot of ingredients missing. The 3 staffer members were all focused on 1 take out order while I sat and watch my food sit ready right in front of them for 10min. It felt like we were forgotten about. I don’t understand why no one could walk 5 steps to bring the food out to customers watching all of this happen.  Good food, relatively quiet. The wait service was excellent.  The trio starter platter is to die for!   Thanks for a great evening.  My son ordered the nachos and the cheese was not melted. It was basically a pile of chips with cheese thrown on top which was bland and disappointing.
We ordered the steak with chimichurri and found the sauce to be bitter.
There used to be way more Mac and cheese choices such as one with blue cheese. It’s too bad that there aren’t more on the menu because those are the best choices on the menu Read more Fabulous service. Loved the food. Would go again to try other dishes.

Was impressed with the number of vegan options on the menu.  The kitchen here turns out some unique and excellent menu items and the bar good cocktails.

Cocktails and wine a bit on the pricey side but they have some affordable options.  I will be visiting again.  Service impeccable. Jolie salle. Peu d'ambiance. Une maman laissait son enfant crier.

Can't wait to go again.  For the prices they’re charging, I expected more than average service, cold side dishes, and overcooked steak. I would not recommend and will not go again.  The food is good and well prepared, the service excellent, but I'm not sure the value for money for lunch is there as the portions are quite small (tiny lobster roll, side fries and salad puny).  The French fries are a real let down.  Cut real potatoes a standard French fry size and fry them to a deep brown in a deep fat fryer.  It's not complicated.

I found fine beverage and food choices.  The Tuscany salad was fresh and perfectly dressed.  On the recommendation of the server, I tried the pastrami sandwich with fries. Substantial portions, careful preparation and attentive service made for a good experience.  The concert offered  a perfect dessert!  We took some friends out for dinner on Friday.  We had a great time.  It was surprisingly quiet and we were seated at a large table.   We ordered the Chowder, black cod, scallops, steaks (ribeye, New York strip) Brussels sprouts, and mushrooms.  We wanted to order some fancy tots but they were out and thought we would try the lobster potato salad.   The steaks were outstanding, with the exemption of what I suspect was communication error somewhere between our order and the the kitchen.  We ordered medium ribeye and medium well strip, but they switched the wellness.  We ate them anyways.   All the dishes were great with exemption of the lobster potato salad.    Presentation was beautiful but for $29 it was a very small dish with one potato and a little lobster than expected.   I would recommend absolutely everything we had, except for that.

Quiet with good service.  Our dinner was and always is delicious. It’s always a pleasure to eat there.  Fabulous dinner- food- presentation - service impeccable  It’s been a while since my husband and I have dined at the Keg (or anywhere). The prices were much lower the last time we were here (way before Covid), but that is “par for the course”. 
Our visit was for my birthday. We were not disappointed. The food was delicious. My husband and I shared a lovely appetizer (a dip with cream cheese, Emmental, and mushrooms). Yum! I ordered the blackened chicken with honey. It wasn’t “blackened”, but it was crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, perfectly cooked, and very tasty. Also, I ordered a delicious side of broccolini with a lemon sauce/glaze (sorry I don’t know the exact names of these dishes, but I wasn’t thinking about writing a review at the time),
My husband ordered the peppercorn steak. He’d never had one before. I recommended it to him, hoping he’d enjoy it. He loved it. Our server brought us a slice of coal miner’s pie (I think that was the name). It was a large wedge of ice cream (chocolate?) cake with a dark cookie bottom, drizzled with caramel and chocolate, with some shaved, roasted almonds. Very nice.
The service was excellent (Margo?), the food delicious, and we left without a complaint. Read more It is a sad day because this is the first time in my life I've ever gone to the keg and had my steak not cooked to order—same with one of my guests. We both ordered our steaks medium, but they were cooked well done—not a hint of pink. Very disappointing. Everything else was fine, but we went there for Fillet Mignon—I am a frequent, patron of the keg and have been going since inception. This was the first time I was ever disappointed. Read more Our waiter was awesome good was good had a great time  From beginning to end at the Keg - Southside we had wonderful service with Ben and Kaylen G. Polite, courteous and a good sense of humour to go with ours. Atmosphere was quieter as we had an early reservation for 5.  Two of us had the classic filet mignon which was perfect for myself as I’m more of a meat and vegetable person so it came with a salad, mushrooms and seasonal veggies but my accompaniment was sautéed veggies. Two had the classic prime rib. All around everyone couldn’t
talk enough good about the experience. Thank you. Read more Fries were cold. Pot pie was tasteless. Poor service.  The serving staff were friendly. 

Unfortunately my dinner did not come as requested so it was taken away to be corrected (no lobster with the steak and lobster order).   The other two people in my party ate while their food was still hot and were almost finished eating when my dinner arrived. Their vegetables were cooked, mine were very hard / undercooked.  We were all very  hungry and ate everything anyway. 

The place was very busy and we recognize mistakes can happen. Happy to see the restaurant was full. Read more Always great service and food. I ordered the pistachio crusted salmon and it was cooked perfectly. Love that they have cauliflower mash as an option as well.",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/51433958.webp

The staff offered to turn up the lights above our table if our low-vision family member needed, and they worked quickly to get drinks and food out to us as soon as we ordered.
The food was very good, fresh, hot, and the perfect amount to compliment our beverages. The sourdough flatbread with oil & vinegar was the table favorite- warm, crispy and simple paired with wine and cider. Also the Manitoba Charcuterie and olives were great to share.

Such a cool experience, the sushi was amazing.  Best Waitress. Room outstanding for us. A good Thanksgiving experience.  A family meal out for my visiting father. Everything was pretty near perfect, it was our first time eating out at Earls and it didn’t disappoint. Every interaction with any of the staff members we had was excellent and all were very friendly. Bryn was our main server and she was attentive and engaging. Prices (given the current climate)  were as expected for the type of restaurant and every course of food was delicious and cooked to perfection, the accompanying wine was great as well. The menu selection is quite broad as well and doesn’t focus on any particular genre of food, there will be something for everyone. My only two minor minor complaints (not that they detracted from enjoying the evening) was the background music was probably one notch too loud and did become encroaching on the conversation a few times, the other was we were seated right by the kitchen, admittedly I could have changed this before we were finally seated, did make things a little noisy. However the whole experience at Earl’s was awesome and added to a great last night in Winnipeg. Read more maddy was our server and she was amazing! she was so friendly and welcoming and made our experience memorable!  Jaz was our server and she was attentive, nice and made great suggestions.  Service was fine until the end. We waited too long for the bill which is not great at lunch especially.  My wife was flying home after a 2-week trip with her girlfriends. I wanted to celebrate her return and had made reservations at Earl’s Polo Park.
Our Server was Kyle and he was attentive, professional, and had a great sense of humour.
I ordered a steak and my wife had a salad. Each entree was perfect. I honestly can’t recall when I enjoyed a steak more than I did this evening.
We finished the meal off by sharing a serving of amazing Pumpkin Pie!
Earls made our entire night out very special; from the Hostess who greeted us as we entered the restaurant to the Manager that stopped by to check on our experience. Great job guys.
Thank you! Read more The service here was awful! We sat in the solarium and got water and menus, and then never saw another wait staff until we flagged one down!

The price to go out nowadays is ridiculous and service is a big component of the outing. Earl’s failed miserably with that. ￼ Read more Reservation was for 6, we ended up having to wait 20-30 minutes to get our table despite having made a reservation. Other than that, service was amazing and our waitress was awesome.  Understaffed. Bringing dinner with dirty appetizer plates poked up on table. Needed to be asked several times to clean up the dirty dishes. All tables in solarium left with dirty tables all evening even though guests have already left hours before. Napkins blown all over the floor and not picked up. Could have been a fall risk for staff/guests. We had to ask for dessert menus etc. was very untidy and dirty . Servers were very polite but definable need more training on how to serve guests regarding  cleaning tables before brining more food. Wasn’t horrible but wasn’t great. Blackened chicken was over spicy, steak with sushi was way too spicy that our friend couldn’t eat it. Chicken fingers were bland. Ranch sauce tasted sour. Clam chowder soup had no clams in it.

Service,ambience, wine and food!!! Girls night or date night it’s fabulous!  Nicolinos is a gem that offers fresh made foods, a warm welcome, and a comfortable place to gather with friends or family.  Excellent food and service. It was a Bomber game so a bit loud but we went early enough it was hardly bothersome. Will definitely be back!  The experience was good as usual.  I would recommend the Penne. Very tasty. Service was great too. Have been several times and will keep going back.  Fantastic experience, food, service and atmosphere. Look forward to next time.  Was seated at a small table for 2 with literally 12 inches separating us from guests on either side of us. Very awkward if trying to have a private conversation. In fairness we asked for a new table and within 5 minutes we had one.  Service was substandard and didn’t really check on us. The pizza crust was so crispy that you couldn’t really cut it with a knife. Had to wait forever to settle our bill.  Seemed a little disorganized.  Do love the atmosphere but could tighten up on some serving staff coordination. Read more Only concern/issue was lighting was very variable and too dark at times.
Lighting kept getting dimmer then brighter throughout the meal.
Overall excellent evening and meal  food and service was great. Large party there while we were there made the wait time for our meal a little longer. Otherwise everything as mentioned was great.  The food and service are always exceptional.  The food is fresh and very tasty.  The bread sticks are served warm. The wine was excellent as well.  Read more Wonderful dinner!

The food was outstanding and Ken (our server) was fantastic!!  Lovely quiet corner ( as we had requested) for a leisurely lunch. Wait staff was excellent, catering to our requests.  We all chose salads which were attractive, huge and delicious. Very pleased with everything.  I am not sure what possessed me to go to an Italian restaurant and order salmon, but it's what I was in the mood for. Unfortunately, like many restaurants in Winnipeg, the salmon was very overcooked and dry. I understand that if it's not a classic dish at a restaurant that most cooks don't know how to cook salmon properly so I'm going to give them a pass on that and take it on the chin that I didn't order something more appropriate to their specializations. I will certainly give them another chance, but will be ordwrinf a more traditional Italian dish. ￼ Read more Had a gift card-never been here!  Very good food and service.  Table situated close to door - would have liked a window seat ( there was one available).  Guess we could have asked-next time!  Nicolino's has amazing good.  always fresh !   And service is outstanding  Great staff and Menu.
The team there knows their menu and is passionate about it. The food is great, nice wine list, good portions.  Fun girls night out. Great food and top notch service!  Read more Nicolino’s is one of our favourite restaurants, as the food and service is consistently very good.  They have recently renovated, and it has certainly improved the atmosphere, especially on the lounge side.  Instead of a restaurant and lounge, it almost looks like a restaurant with a bar in the middle. I think a few minor tweaks on the lounge side could still be made in terms of soundproofing, but otherwise it’s aesthetically pleasing.  Looking very glam!  Food was delicious as usual, and our server, Ken was on his A game for sure.  We started with the Chef’s Selection which was a tasty assortment of Italian meats and cheeses, sundried tomatoes, olives, spicy eggplant, crostini and assorted spreads.  Then we had Caesar Salad, Feta Salad, and Sorrento’s Salad.  All were delicious, but the Feta Salad is my favourite.  I added the grilled salmon to my salad as my main entree and it was very good. All the entrees were very good.  We ended with Crème Brûlée and Carrot Cake.  The carrot cake was really moist and delicious but it wasn’t the normal icing which was a little disappointing, as it is usually so good!  Overall, a very good dining experience! Read more Food was good. Very fresh and was hot when arrived at table.

Our waiter Marco was excellent. Was attentive but not overly attentive, which is preferable.  Fabulous calamari as always - chicken parm sandwich is the GOAT - friendly professional service -  beautiful space  Had Ken as our waiter and he is exceptional as can describe the meal totally with enthusiasm.
We have been there numerous times and we have never had a bad meal. The noodles are always a la dente and the flavours are awesome. The owner Nick is always on top of things. If you’ve never been - go. You will not be disappointed  By the time you read this, the bar renovation will likely be complete, but the power tools in use throughout our stay did nothing good for our lunch experience.  And we felt ripped off by our bill:  if you order the mini pizza ""with two toppings""/ salad combo ($16 on the printed menu and on line), it apparently does NOT come with two toppings.  We confirmed when we ordered that the toppings we choose were not 'premium' but were still charged an additional $4 per person.  We questioned the charge when presented with the bill but the server insisted it was correct.  This means the menu is not 'misleading', it's wrong.  This lunch at Nicolino's left a very poor taste in my mouth. Read more As always really enjoyed our visit to this restaurant … the team is amazing!! Thanks again crew!  Always great service and amazing food! Love the new Reno’s, can’t wait to return!  First time here. Fantastic dinner with friends. Tasteful deco all the way through.

Service was great-we knew it would be super busy but we got our food with time to spare while on our lunch hour. Thanks to our fabulous server Aretti!  Food was excellent, but there is construction underway at the restaurant. Because of that, and a large party at a neighbouring table, the noise level was off the charts.

We weren’t sure about the neighborhood but it turns out it was fine and the restaurant a little gem.  2 diners had gyros and they said they were quite good. Other 2 had the daily special which was chicken with cheese and mushroom topping. Had a good glass of pinot grigio to go with the chicken dish. This dish also came with a starter salad.  Lovely setting for a nice anniversary dinner. Great food as always.  The food was flavourful and enjoyable but the server was not into doing his job. We had to ask and wait long for everything. Too frustrating. I won’t be going back anytime soon.  Our male waiter was just ok ! Our female and younger waiter were good !   The food was delicious, although the Mousaka seemed different. It has previously been firmer and spiced differently. Our female server was bubbly and friendly and competent. The young man was less competent. The ten children under the age of 8 made the space incredibly noisy and chaotic. We may wait to return when the patio is open.

Highly recommend going to the Blue Marble.
We will go again for sure!  Delicious pickerel meal, proceeded by a lovely soup.  Food was delicious, service was nice.  I had the duck breast ""with peas and fingerling potatoes"" that was 6 peas and 3 small pieces of potato 🤣  Honestly, wow! Really good food, reasonably priced and great service from Ryan.  This was our first time but we will be back! 👍  Server was kind, sweet and tried her best. She was by herself so it took a while to get her attention but overall if there would of been more staff it would of been amazing.  Seafood was amazing  One of the best plant based meals I've had in a long time....while 
2 others had Steak bites, 1 had seafood pasta. 1 had Salmon on salad.....all excellent.
Chicken liver appetiser and tomato soap.... very good.   For an airport hotel restaurant this was a pleasant surprise. Service was attentive the menu surprisingly adventurous, with generous small plate options to share that tasted good.  If stuck at YWG airport, worth the walk over.  We chose Blue Marble for a family birthday event googling “best restaurants in Winnipeg”.  Obviously a gross error. We arrived a bit late and two family members had already ordered cocktails. One choice was ginger infused and tasted off. Our waiter told us “I make it like the recipe; you order it, it’s yours”. We probably should have taken our cue there because not one of the four cocktails we ordered after that were quite right.  My husband loves a Manhattan and as he said “I could have made a much better one myself”. We ordered from both the small plates and larger portion sides of the menu. We ordered 5 dishes in total to share between 4 people. Two dishes were very good. One was average and two were way below par. The chicken livers were chunks of liver in a heavy brown “beefy” sauce that overwhelmed the dish. The stuffed bread was so oily it virtually “swam” in the plate making it gooey instead of nicely chewy. Usually when you go to a top end restaurant and the waiter knows it is a birthday celebration, they offer a dessert selection for the person having the birthday.  Not here. We ordered two desserts to share between us,. Again, a hit and a miss. One, a pavlova, was not chewy on the outside and soft on the inside but so hard it was difficult to eat. The other, a chocolate panne cotta was very good. So overall, you certainly take your chances with this restaurant - you may luck out and get something very good but likely will have that outweighed by dishes that are almost uneatable.  For a dinner costing over $250, and a special celebration we expected much much more. Read more Great service and delicious food. Would return again.  Service was impeccable, food was delicious. Highly recommend the calamari, duck confit, and pork belly.  The menu is very limited and the details poor. The food I ordered gave what was in it and when I got it I didn’t find half of the items on it that it said. I ordered something different and it was good. Still charged me full price for both meals.  Very accommodating. We had 2 young children with us and they made a special pasta dish for them.  Fantastic place to go just before your flight or any time!  I guess that for a location that almost no local would consider (being part of the airport), there was lots of empty tables. The food, service, and wine selection was really nice though. If you’re making a last minute decision to have a nice dinner, nice wine… walk right in.  Always love to go there for a quiet dinner, service are excellent!! Only to found out last night they took my favorite dishes , fish and chips away 😩😩! Why !!  We typically enjoy our meals here... But this time it was very slow (a flight came in and they had few staff... Not thier fault) the pork belly was overcooked and dry, the fish dish was way over done, dry and overly 'fishy'... (Yes, it was fish but this wasn't good at all) and the validated parking was gone... So we had to pay an additional $10 on our $200 bill.   Brett was great & attentive, had a nice, quiet booth too, satisfying my request.  Made a reservation…showed up on time. Restaurant was closed.
Was staying in the hotel. Apparently, there was no staff!?  We wondered why it was easy to get a reservation on a Saturday night. Ordered 2 Caesers to drink and they were good. We started with the calamari and it was cooked fine but was very bland. My wife got the pork belly bowl and again very bland with little flavour. I ordered the steak, med. rare and it came out well done. No worries, they made another. I ate some of the fries and veggies and by the time the new steak came my wife was done with her meal and again the steak was well done. I let our server know and wondered why this could happen not once but twice because there was only 3 other tables in the restaurant and they were all done and eating dessert before our food came. Anyways, the server was very pleasant and understood our frustration and only charged us for our drinks and my wife’s supper. Never again. The manager would not even acknowledge us as I paid our bill. Read more Pleasant surprise after a rocky start. Parking is an adventure. Food was very good. Presentation lovely.  Great food and ambiance. Awesome service.  Awesome experience at the Blue Marble as always! When in Winnipeg, this is my go to restaurant!!!  Thanks to Ryan (and Adam too)  in providing excellent service as usual. We always enjoy our dining experiences here, the food is really great. Soups are always changing and definitely a must have, burger was very tasty and the tuna was excellent. Delighted to see some desserts are coming on board - carrot cake and lemon tart were two enjoyed on recent visits. Would be nice to have some rolls or something to have with the salad and or soup to start the dinner with. Look forward to the evolving menu. Keep up the great work! Read more The waitress was nice:) The drink menu is really large, good champagne last, The appetizers were the best things calamari and roasted brussels sprouts.

Would have liked more explanation about their menu as its not traditional and more seasonal.

Their menu indicates small plates.. These are basically ""lunch"" size portitions.

(We had a reservation) Then we sat and after ordering food they asked us to move to another table. The waitress was great. Management was awful.  Brooklyn was fabulous server. Good always top notch!

The drinks were okay as they were either more on sweeter side or tangy side. Over all experience was good.  Food was all good. Four of us had lunch together. I had the crispy chicken burger. It was quite tasty. One had the beef dip which he said was good also but messy to eat . Needed to use utensils. One of the other 2 had an appetizer and the other a slad.

It was my daughter’s 17th Birthday and the staff couldn’t be better.
Thank you for everything.  I ordered the chicken Medeira rigatoni since that is my favourite dish when I go to the Cheesecake Factory. This was quite disappointing since there was very little chicken, mushrooms, or sauce. Lots is pasta. The service was good though.  Came to this location for my birthday dinner and it was amazing.

No cutlery or napkins were given, we had 2 ask 4 them when our food arrived. When we were finished, we asked 4 the bill, we waited another 10 min 4 it. When you have 2 wait 10 min, it feels like 20. Food was delicious but the service ruined the moment.  We love the new sophisticated decor and have found the service and food consistently good.  Nice touch having mger ask how everything was.

The Keg is my favourite place for a great meal with great friends. Read more Read more Great 40th anniversary dinner, everything was great .... wierd butter for the lobster tails .... looked and tasted like melted butter NOT clarified butter.  One of the best meals we’ve had in a restaurant in a long time. Service and good were excellent. We will definitely go back to this location.  Some of the food was poorly prepared: twice baked potatoes were charred black; one wedge salad had the yellow heart in the serving; tenderloin dryer than usual - one was blacked on one edge;  escargot was not tasty - reconsider your recipe . Too much of the food wasn’t prepared to Keg Standard! Disappointing!  My wife and  I really like going to the keg for dinners.  

I really hate it when they  sit us in the two person tables in the cafeteria style . Where ther is two feet between the tables and no privacy.  You can join in on the table next to your conversation.  I am paying good money for a meal and would like to have a conversation with my wife and not other patrons. This has happened on our last two occasions and will not be coming back if it happens again.  If we wanted that style of a meal we would go to a food court.
This really shows how you try and increase revenues by slipping in another table. Read more Perfect great tasting food and drinks,as usual-the Keg has never failed me since I first discovered the place in the eighties.  Food was good, service was amazing.  Company was the best. 

Autumn our waitress was fantastic, never an empty drink all night, very attentive.  Another great dinner at The Keg. Kudos to our server, kitchen and the manager on a job well done.  I have been a fan of the Keg for years. This visit was disappointing based on the food. I always order the baseball steak, it was difficult to cut, very chewy. Disappointing. Seasonal veg were overcooked. I had a wonderful server and really enjoyed my evening despite poor my disappointment in my meal.  The service was excellent and the food was delicious however one of the guests specifically requested no chives/green onions on his baked potato. It came loaded with them. The other three guests in our party had Keg Classic dinners. It wasn’t until we paid for our meal and left that we realized that none of us had received our mushrooms that were to be included with our meals. At the additional cost between a standard and classic meal, we paid significantly to have only a salad included.  The cost of enjoying a high end restaurant is considered a treat in todays economy and although it was prepared perfectly, it’s short comings like this that make it into future decisions on where to dine out.

With that a glass of Lohr Chardonnay for Kerri and Lohr Cabernet for me. Excellent wine.

Kale caesar salad was 10/10, foccacia 9/10, poutine 5/10 (fries too hard and cruchy, even when covered in gravy and cheese).  
Stuffed chicken breast was actually good but I could not find a hint of goat's cheese as indicated in the menu. Had it not referred to the goat's cheese, I would give full marks but there just was no goat cheese stuffing. The roasted potatoes and vegetables were very good. 
Our server was excellent, full marks for her attention.

Breakfast and lunch menus are very good however food quality for dinner can use some improvement.  We had a very nice dinner.

Food was  delicious,   The restaurant overlooks the pond so we were able to watch the ducks in the water.  The greenery and water make the experience welcoming.  The service was great, and the food most enjoyable.  As we were both celebrating birthdays, the restaurants policy of providing free deserts to celebrate this occasion was an added bonus.

It's a wonderful way to enjoy the beauty of Kildonan Park.  I recently had the pickerel and chips, and while the pickerel in the tempura batter was excellent—light, crispy, and flavorful—the rest of the meal fell short. Unfortunately, the fries were overcooked and hard, making them difficult to enjoy. The coleslaw was also dry, lacking the moisture and tang you’d expect.

I love the dining room that overlooks the pond and park area. Server was attentive. Recommended for all times if the day!  The food and service were excellent.

Sooo we Splurged and I ordered lobsters The2Tails I was so looking forward to them but was disappointed that they were cold for 50 something dollars they shouldn’t be cold￼!!!the service was very good, she got a 35$ tip on our order, but…..if I WAS TIPPING sorry to say $35 for cold lobster tails would’ve not happened, even though the waitress was vg. Read more We were in the group area which resulted in a noisy situation even though we made reservations for two people. And the cars that parked in the front (in the 10 min parking area) had there lights on which glared on us throughout the meal. But the food was fantastic as usual.  Two of us ordered the rib sampler dinner . It was a nice portion but we could not taste any difference between the four different flavours .  The server knew it was my birthday, and the other birthday people at other tables got a song and ice cream, yet I didn’t.  Ice cream would have been nice.  I am not the type of person who goes to restaurants in the last moments before closing time because I understand that the server and cooks also have a life and want to go home. However, I want to say that the service offered was equal or better than usual. The food was delicious. Thank you.  The best baby backs in town! The creamy coleslaw is just like grandma used to make! Highly recommended!   We popped in for our annual birthday celebration for my brother and as usual everything was fantastic. Service was top notch and the food was incredible.  We were sitting right beside the kitchen. It was a bit load.  Food was good and served hot! The waiter was attentive and pleasant,.  We had a wonderful anniversary dinner. Our waiter was awesome, nickname Willie. He was very personable, friendly and attentive. 
Only downside of the evening was where we were seated.  Right beside the kitchen.  There were plenty of other booths available that I would have preferred to sit at. It was rather noisy with the staff talking and the clanking of dishes.
Food was outstanding! It came out hot and exactly as ordered. Read more Ribs were tender, service was great.  The only set back: it gets loud in there.  Paige was our server snd she was awesome, the food  was so flavorful.  The ribs were charred, the vegetables looked like they had been under the heat lamp for hours, the Cesar salad was very small for the money and we went there for my wife's birthday as I indicated when I made the reservation yet nothing was mentioned!  Food, service was excellent as usual. This time we sat outside on patio. Very lovely evening for my husband and I.  It was a great dining experience. Server was excellent! Food was fast & delicious!  Our server Michael was the best one we’ve ever had in any restaurant hands down! He was funny, attentive, kind and made the kids laugh! We appreciate this since we don’t get many servers that actually enjoy their work.

The food was delicious! Had the full rack ribs, my sister got the shrimp and rib combo, my cousin got the sirloin and shrimp. All tasty. The kids got chicken strips and fries. They also enjoyed it. Read more  We haven't been to Tony Roma's for a while as we don't live close to one. It was a nice change, good service, good food can't go wrong. Ample parking I would recommend this restaurant to anybody who hasn't been there before. Also its on open table for reservations which makes it nice.  Don't go to Tony Roma's that often but always good service and food at both Winnipeg locations  The steak and wild mushrooms appetizer was delicious definitely 💯

Anna. Our waitress was great and made the dinner out excellent  I ordered the rib and medallion dinner. I had to send back a medallion times to be redone.  I kept it the third time as it was as good as it was gonna get.  It was still over cooked but not as bad as the first time.  Great food. Good service. Can be noisy if loud people are at a table near you.
I have never had a bad meal here ❤️  Food was excellent. Wait staff was friendly and helpful.  Excellent value.  Will definitely be returning.  Not very busy when we got there. Seated immediately. Our server was very good. My wife and i enjoyed our appetizers and meals. A little expensive but with the cost of food now that is the case at most restaurants .Would definitely go back again.  It was enjoyable evening, it was just like we remembered. Our server Mike was excellent.  My partner and I had a very good time there. The food was amazing my goodness!! It is a really cozy ambience which was something that I liked and enjoyed. I would most definitely go back again and recommend to friends.  Scott is fantastic. Really entertaining and enjoys his job.",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/65479284.webp

Chang’s is the first multi-unit restaurant concept in the U.S. to honour and celebrate the 2,000-year-old tradition of wok cooking as the center of the guest experience. Since inception, P.F.

All the dishes we tried were excellent!  The food was good but the delivery of the food was staggered. Nobody got their food at the same time. Two people got theirs then a ten minute wait and two more and then later two more. It seemed that they were both under staffed or serving the Skip the Dishes first.
Our waitress was very attentive to one of us who had a seafood allergy. We appreciated that. Read more I was very disappointed to find out when we showed up for our reservation, the restaurant didn’t have it. They gave me some excuse about the  open table system sometimes doesn’t work.  A very enjoyable dinner with friends.  Workers provided good and friendly services👍.  The food was definitely not as good as it was on previous visits . Won ton soup bland and luke warm. Spring rolls were good as was kung pow shrimp. We had 3 other dishes , tofu, chicken and beef dishes. All fairly tasteless and very dry. Food definitely not worth the $140.00 spent . Food at other PF Chang locations including Las Vegas much different and significantly better.  Not the best dining experience due to the service. Restaurant was not busy at all, so I would have expected the service to be especially good, and it wasn’t.  Our server was friendly enough and was able to answer questions about the menu and make recommendations, but was not very attentive at all and made errors with the order.  She seemed genuinely disinterested in being there and did the bare minimum.  She did not check back throughout the meal, offer to refill beverages, or ask us if we would like to order dessert.  She was nowhere to be found when there were issues with the order. As per usual the food was really good though!  We ordered appetizers to start: Chang’s Lettuce Wraps, Crispy Green Beans, and The Original Dynamite Shrimp.  All 3 of these dishes were really flavourful! Main Entrees:  Kung Pao Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Signature Lo Mein, and Pad Thai.  Again, all the dishes were delicious!  The bottom line… food was great but the service could have been so much better. Read more The food was good, but found the service underwhelming for an upscale chain.  I can use 3 words to describe our dining experience at P.F. Chang’s… fast , friendly, and flavourful!  The food was delicious.  The service was top notch. We were in and out in a timely manner.  I started by ordering a cocktail, the Asian Pear Mojito.  It was good, but a little too sweet for my liking.  We ordered the Crispy Green Beans and Chang’s Lettuce Wraps to start.  Both were really tasty, and more than enough for 3 people.  Our main entrees were the Crispy Honey Chicken, the Kung Pao, and the Signature Lo Mein.  All 3 dishes were really delicious, and portions were generous.  We all asked for takeout boxes to bring home the leftovers.  No room for dessert unfortunately!  The servers were all very good… polite, friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu items.  Food arrived quickly, and the servers checked back multiple times throughout the meal, quick to clear away the dishes.  Overall a very positive dining experience.  I highly recommend P. F. Chang’s if you are looking for a casual night out.  Reservations recommended. Read more Our server Skye was very fast and pleasant. The food was great!!  We have dined here about 5 times now. Every experience has been amazing until this one.
We were seated and had a reservation.
The restaurant was not busy at all. Over 10 mins goes by and the server did not come to our table. I walked up to what appeared to be the manager playing on his phone and asked if we have a server assigned to us.
Maria was our server and her lack of enthusiasm for her job was very upfront. Her demeanor was cold and unfriendly. She did not properly take our drink order, our food order was again messed up and it was actually cold. Very strange as it’s usually sizzling hot. She didn’t come back one time to check on us which was unfortunate since one of the dishes was not accurate. When it came time to pay she stood over us like a vulture even though I expressed we needed a moment. We are big tippers but there was nothing to tip on and when she didn’t receive a tip she gave us the nastiest look and walked away. I have never experienced anything like this. Thankfully it wasn’t our first time here or it would be the last. If and when we go back we will absolutely make sure this girl does not serve us. Just terrible! Read more Read more Overall a great experience. The food was delicious and served to the table promptly.
Very helpful staff!  Service was fast actually too fast. We ordered and appetizer then our meal. The appetizer came and 2 minutes later the entire meal. The timing was off but otherwise good  Great experience! The food was fanastic for everyone in the family.

We will be coming back  Not sure if the restaurant was short staff .  Our group was five people, the meal we ordered, did not come all at the same time.  There were gaps in when all of us received our food.  Did see few other tables getting their food, when the first person was served at our table and rest had to wait.
Food was good, but not hot temperature wise.  The orange chicken is very good but if you don't like spices don't order as it is spicy. Read more The service was quick and friendly. The meal arrived in a timely manner and was tasty.  Good food and service.  Overall great experience.  The food was awesome and the service was great! We were greeted as soon ad we arrived.

Took the parents in law for the dining experience and it was stimulating show and a little spicy for them - a most enjoyed evening  We reserved a table at PF Chang’s for dinner on New Year’s Eve. When we got to the restaurant, there was a bottleneck of people in the doorway and it seemed chaotic. We weren’t expecting a lot. We were seated at a high-top table in the bar area. Our server was Winta. She turned the entire experience around. Her smile, her kindness and her lovely demeanour changed our evening. The food was great too! Read more Read more Initial greeting was good but after our appetizer and dinner was served no one returned.  We had to use our appetizer plate and flatware to eat our entrees.  No water service.  Would not go back mainly because of the service and the high prices for the food, it was good but not outstanding.  Very pricey given the quantity and quality of food.  It was good. Just very expensive. Extra 6$ a plate for fried rice. Bill was 195$ plus tip for 4 people sharing some plates. Next time I will order Chinese food for half the price and still have leftovers next day.  Excellent service and delicious food! A great evening at a family favourite  Visited on a Monday evening hoping for a pleasant family dinner. The food was average, the ambience was decent, but unfortunately, the service fell short. Despite the restaurant being quiet, our server seemed disinterested, neglecting our table for the entire duration. No water refills, no food quality checks, and a frustrating wait for the check. Even more disappointing was the manager's lack of engagement, seemingly oblivious to the service quality. A reminder to the management: customers seek an experience, not just a meal.

Thanks for a pleasant lunch.  Two can dine on wednesday is great! Good service for middle of the week  Always great food at Fionn’s.  Had especially great service.  Fionn’s is always in our top 5 Friday night destination.  Well, let me start off with saying I was very very disappointed. We gone my husband and myself at least 2 to 3 times a month for fish and chips. I was disappointed my fish came to our table, so dried out that it was brown crispy there was no fish. The fish was stuck to the batter. The fish was not even a cen It was so dried out.

Read more Worth the trip for the Pub Nachos. Delicious  It was good seating for a team windup.

Our server made the whole night along with the great fish and chips  We were seated right away, the waiter was fantastic and his recommendation of Chicken ￼  schnitzel was great.  Can't complain about the food as we didn't get to order.   First the drink we wanted wasn't available (on the menu) and then we were told the gift card (Ultimate) wasn't accepted there anymore (even though the name is on the card).       So we left and went to Montana's where we have a lovely meal using the gift cards.  Read more Read more Always a good spot to have decent food either sharing or your own plate. Never disappoints.

We enjoyed great food, beverages and service.  It was an amazing experience and the food is super delicious! I will definitely return for more.  We went for an anniversary dinner.  It was not very busy at about 7:00PM , probably about 35% occupied.  We ordered the chicken schnitzel and Guiness steak and mushroom pie.  Both were fantastic.  My wife thought it was a bit heavy on the salt.  The mashed potatoes and vegetables were excellent.  We also had a mini donut platter for dessert.  It came with ice cream a caramal dipping sauce and raspberry compote.  All the food was excellent.

The restaurant is sort of split into two where there is a bar side with seating and a fmaily side.  It used to be that familes with children sat on the family side but it appears they allow families with young children to sit on the bar side.   Perhaps this was due to tryiung to keep all the people together when the client count is lower.

They don't do anything special for a special occassion so don't expect a free dessert or anything.  Regardless, we will be back. Read more The service and food were both excellent. Will return  First time there and will be back . Food was so tasty and hot . The service was friendly and awesome.  Great food and service. Pricing very reasonable. Never had a bad meal here! Highly recommend!  A bit light on the chips for the signature fish and chips dish. Otherwise great pub experience!  The noise level was unpleasant as we were seated in the bar side. Last time we went we were on the restaurant side. This was not presented as an option when making the reservation. I would not have gone had I known.

A little too pricey.  Great food and super clean and quiet. My  friend and I had a Bellini and it wasn’t how we remembered them being served and it was mostly juice and so it was ice left in the glass but everything else was really tasty. All four of us enjoyed it.  Good food! Kid friendly, great ambiance, spacious seating!  Enjoyed our server (Ryan) and his energy. The food was not only well presented but tasted great  Enjoyed our lunch. It was Mother’s Day so it was busy but expected.   Food was good and the manager was regularly checking on tables to ensure everyone was looked after.  We came because we were in the area I needed a place to eat. We’ve been here in the past before when we were younger, so the menu is pretty predictable. The food is always good and the brownie dessert is always something we want. Can’t say this is gourmet level food, but it is good. ￼  Boston Clam Chowder and Blackened Mahi Mahi were excellent.

The Chicken Madeira Rigatoni was just okay, I liked the flavor, but the pasta was a bit too firm for me.  Our server tonight, Ryan, was great. The atmosphere was lively, and the appetizers we had were all so good! The whipped feta and roasted tomatoes were top notch as usual, and so was the calamari.

Everything was good; the service was a little slow and didn’t seem to know the menu very well, perhaps the server was new!?  Moxie's is becoming a 'go'to' luncheon place for me. The menu is varied and the food is always very good to excellent. It's sufficiently busy to have a cozy vibe but sufficiently quiet to have a good conversation with my table mate(s). The service invariably seems attentive without being intrusive, and almost always the house manager passes by once to see if we are happy wth everything. I also like to option at bill paying time to round up to the next dollar to give to a charity for children. It doesn't cost each patron very much but this kind of gift can quickly add up over time. And it's optional. Read more Great service overall!  We got seated at our table quickly.  Our waiter was friendly.  We got our food order quickly.  The food tasted delicious.
Moxie's is one of my favorite restaurants and I would definitely come here again!  Had a very good experience with my wife and 3 young boys. Had a nice booth, service was on point.  The waitress was awesome, she had only been working there for 4 days and was great. But…. The restaurant was absolutely freezing. We went there for my mom’s birthday and it was not enjoyable at all. We wore our coats and it was still cold. Instead of staying longer to have cocktails we left after dinner. Too cold.  Came for dessert as I was craving  White Chocate Brownie but ended up ordering Chicken Cashew Lettuce Wrap as well.

Overall would most likely not come again  Two of our dishes--the chipotle mango chicken and the rigatoni chicken Madeira--were excellent.  My cocktail (one of the margaritas) was prepared in a somewhat lackluster way, and while tasty, for the price it could have used more attractive presentation and garnishing.

I told the server if the bartender didn’t know how to make it, I’d order something else. He didn’t know how to make it. Tried but miserable failure.
The server Mila, was useless. We had to go ask for cutlery and napkins after our food was served. Had to flag her down to get another drink, and even after asking the bartender to send her over (as a side was missed) she didn’t show up. I would avoid her tables if possible.

Only reason for four stars was the volume of the music.  Uncomfortably loud.  Could barely hear anyone across the table. I hope this doesn't happen again as it does sour the experience. Read more Restaurants need to decide … shrinkflation or inflation .  Not both.     I had the blackened chicken burger and the best way to describe it was to imagine a McDonald’s regular cheese burger (in size and texture) and replace the thin patty with a thin strip of chicken… and then get charged $22 for it.    It was without doubt the worst chicken burger I have ever ordered (for more than $5).

Patio is nice and we had a 4 seater “low” table which is ideal for toddlers not to fall off high top chairs. It was actually nice upon first being seated that there was also a lounge couch beside us, not in use, so we were able to lay out the baby on the couch with toys (and my hands on him of course) and enjoy some wine. Everything was downhill from here. 
We arrived for our 6pm reservation and had reviewed the menu at home prior to arrival so that we could promptly order food at the same time as drinks to ensure a faster turn around of getting food in front of the toddlers. Well, after an hour of waiting on the kids plain noodles in marinara, some tater tots, and a couple of our adult salads (still a very simple thing.. no appy or anything) the lovely couple next to us were pointing out how well behaved our toddlers are patiently waiting. 
Any parent knows what a compliment that is when you’ve given them a special (sugary) drink to cheers dad on Father’s Day (they split a Shirley temple) on empty stomachs, approaching bed time and managing their hunger. Once we hit the 1.5 hour mark of waiting though, without any update from our server until now and we’ve surpassed bedtime, even my 5 month old was approaching his limit. Would we even have had time to finish our meals if we stayed considering minors are not allowed in the facility after 8pm (and it was now 7:30pm)? 
So as fate would have it we were packing up and giving up, only for our food to arrive along with the obligation of now having to pay for an aweful experience and cold food to-go, on what should have been a celebratory evening where my kids were supposed to be more likely to be the biggest “problem”. 
Fast forward to home, sitting down to a container of beyond drenched salad (can we get some salad with this dressing?) we both gagged down what we could and tossed the rest. No kids dessert or veg provided Read more Many things went wrong. Didn’t have our reservation, didn’t get food for 1.75 hrs. 1 hr after ordering we were told two meals were not available and to choose something else. Our appetizer came out after 1.25 hr.  No one came to refill our waters or drinks. Chocolate cake was dry but other food was good once we got it.  One person ordered coffee as her beverage and didn’t get it for a long time- asked for it a few times.  Most of us had never been to this restaurant and most of us won’t go back. Read more The food took about an hour to get to the table. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and there was barely any chicken in there. It seemed like they cooked a chicken finger and cut it into four pieces and put 1/4 in one half of the wrap and 1/4 in another wrap and the rest in another order. The server did well it would be more the kitchen that needed work  Had a good dinner! I had the Ribeye special and she had chicken sliders and spinach dip. Courtney was a great server. My only complaint would be that her dinner was served and Courtney had to go looking for mine as they didn’t bring out mine.
Outside of that, was the best experience we’ve had in a year.  Nice to be able to sit outside in the patio, but very loud    rock music playing.  Taco salad was rather bland.  Kale salad was dry in some parts & soggy in others.  Cobb salad and nachos were good!  Would look for a different patio.  Went for a work event.  Food was fantastic!  Drinks were great too!  Service was very slow however.  Great food, service and friendly helpful staff. Lots of TVs so comfortable to eat here alone. The speakers are too loud so can't hear others at your table. Not a place to go to if you want to have a conversation.",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/6/28689391.webp

Great food and the service was phenomenal. Mark did a great job in taking care of us. Only negative was it was my brother’s birthday and they didn’t provide us with a celebratory dessert like The Keg. Perhaps the management staff would like to look into this further if they want to better compete with other restaurants in the category.  Your baby backs are awesome! The service is excellent! We’ll be back!  Service was decent.   Portions were decent but think 
overpriced for what you get.  Ribs were just OK and I've 
had better coleslaw.  We went for date night. The service was good, not over the top. My husband has the back rib sampler and really enjoyed it. I had the Fillet Medallions and Lobster Tail. Unfortunately, I had to send my lobster tail back. It was cooked perfectly but over-seasoned (salted) to the point of being inedible. They remade it and it was perfect! We have been here many times and the steak and lobster tail is my usual but our server suggested the fillet medallions and lobster tail and I'm so glad she did it was delish!

The rubbings are a good value while other items, such as seafood, have increased in cost.  Overall great dining experience!  I always go with the full rack of ribs and my two sides (usually fries and slaw) plus an 18 ounce bud.  Great Food and Atmosphere with AWESOME service from Leah.  The overall vibes in the restaurant was nice. The waiter who served us was funny and provided an excellent services. The only disappointment was the food quality. The salmon was tasted a bit fishy, the taste of paste sauce and the steak was not as rich as expected.  Portions are at least a third smaller and a third more expensive than around 10 years prior. Food is good but literally no value in what you are paying for it.  Great food and prompt and courteous service. 
Our server was knowledgeable about gluten free options  Great food, great service.  Not up to their usual standard. We all had to send the steaks back so we had to eat our sides and wait for the steak which took at least 15 minutes. We did get new steaks which were somewhat better but we didn’t get any compensation. The poor server did her best and we have been there many times before.  ordered onion loaf that you can’t go wrong with starting with this.

Read more Service was very good but we had ordered the fish tacos but waitress came back and said they didn’t have fish so we could get shrimp or chicken instead if we wanted.

Thank you.  Food was great, service was excellent. We have a great time and would for sure return. I have been telling many friends about the great experience we had.  The restaurant was quite dark which made it hard to read the small print on the 
 menu; both my husband and I forgot our reading glass's at home.
We will go back again.  The food was good. The only issue I had was we felt like the waitress was rushing us to place the order. One of the person in our group came 10mins after we were seated and as soon as that person came in and sat, she came to take the order. He didn’t even get the time to check the menu. Everything else was good.  Food was amazing, server was excellent. Overall a great experience  Food was ok. Disappointed in the portion size of the Royal Bangkok bowl.  Shrunk in size for more $$.

Food was fabulous.  A great dinner out  No problems - we were seated right away - waitress extremely attentive!  Very pleasant as well. 
The food was exactly as described. I would recommend this restaurant.  For the most part the food was not great, our server was fantastic.  That was refreshing but probably not enough to bring us back.  The noise level was horrendous, with a large table with screaming kids.  Great food and ambience. I had the rib eye which was done perfectly as requested.  I added mushrooms which were worth the extra cost.  The sirloin bites appetizer was great as well. My wife loved her  chicken quesadillas. Overall a great experience and we will return with family next time.  Highly recommend!!  Bought a steak and a Nashville chicken sandwich. Steak was under cooked. Got charged twice and didn’t get a refund. It will take 3-5 business days to get my refund back. Overall food and service was great.  We were a party of three on a Tuesday evening so the restaurant was not too busy. We all ordered steaks and everyone's steak was cooked perfectly. The food was excellent and so was the service.

They did not ask if we would like coffee or dessert.  But over all the group had a good time and the food was good.  The food as usual is delicious.  Austin our server was very good - helping us with
our choices along the way.  We wanted the steak bites to be cooked a little differently and Austin very quickly asked the kitchen if they could accommodate us- 
and they did!!  We frequent this restaurant often and it never disappoints. Read more Read more Food tasted awesome but was about 10% over priced. I get that this economy has increased costs across the board but I did not feel I got great value for my money. And service was not great - had to search someone down to get refills on our drinks.  We chose the Steak Sandwich, the meat was very tough and fatty.  It tasted OK, however, tough to eat.  Our server was fine, however, they had a hard time finding my reservation and then discovered she was looking at the wrong date.  The noise level was way too high, tough to have any kind of conversation without yelling.  This is our second time to Mr. Mikes. The first time the food was pretty good - the side veggies though were inconsistently cooked. You had carrots that were basically raw all the way to mushy and the issue was definitely consistency in the cuts. Now I like a more firm carrot in terms of cooking so when I saw basically raw I really do mean could not pierce it with a fork without considerable effort. 
The Chimichurri was very earthy, bland and overly spice. It was more of a pureed herb combination than a chopped herb sauce highly disappointed. 
The steaks are cooked well and are well executed. The unfortunate part of the veggie sides is there are no choices so on this our second visit the veggies were beets and carrots and some of us were not a fan of beets. Add to that they were sauce with some unknown sauce. One in our group had a beef dip sandwich and the ""jus"" was extremely thick (more a gravy then Jus) and overly salty. 
One in our party had the fish and chips and they were sick overnight, their food seemed to be sufficiently cooked; however, it was extremely greasy and the paper on the plated served under the fish disintegrated easily because of how greasy the food was - it was like the food from the fryer was not blotted first and then plated. 
Our service started out amazing and then once food arrived it tapered off - often having to search for our server to get drink refills. It was not a busy night with less than half of the restaurant full.  We also waited approximately 15 minutes upon arriving for a staff member to greet us at the front door despite having a reservation (and us poking our head through the doors to find someone). The upside is definitely the board games they have to play during supper. Read more We had a great meal and our server was very good. Thanks.

Will go back again and again.  We dined in to celebrate my son's 26th birthday.  We were greeted when we came in and were asked to sit down anywhere.  I booked a reservation before coming the restaurant.

We ordered shrimpin' sirloin and bbq beauty platter (two order of each).
The steak was served a little warm and only comes with 5 small pieces of onion rings.  They could do better if they served with a little bit more onions or perhaps fries.  I had to asked for steak sauce sauce as the meat is a bit dry.
The half rack baby ribs on the bbq beauty platter was also dry and lacking bbq sauce.

Terrible service.  The server could not correctly hear.   
Not a great lunch.  I will not be going back to this location for a business lunch.  It was busy but the service was still really good   We had reservations but the restaurant was obviously overbooked.

Fortunately the restaurant was relatively empty.  If we come to this Boston Pizza, no OpenTable reservations!  The staff were very good, otherwise.  To be honest, it has been a long time since going to Boston Pizza.  I recall their food being better.  It is not bad, just ok.  We went to BP as a birthday request.  They don't do anything special for birthdays, apparently.  
We had salt and pepper wings, Thai Chili wings, jambalaya, chicken tenders and fries.  I asked for hot water, which they served with lemon.  
From a service perspective they were very good.  With few patrons, I guess that is expected.
From a food standpoint, it was good, not spectacular.  
Ambiance was great since it was relatively empty.  Still, there were some youg kids so if you want a relatively quiet restaurant, BP is not for you.
If there is a birthday request to go again, I would go. Read more Staff was very good.  All was good. Took my daughter & her friend and didn’t know kids eat free 🤷🏻‍♀️ everything was served hot, service was good.

dine here regularly!  This was my first visit to block and blade .
The food was very tasty , had the brisket melt with apple cranberry salad . Both were excellent . The only issue is the wait staff . We were sitting at our table for a good 1/2 hour with no acknowledgement and no water service . She did apologize for the wait but I had made reservations in advance so not sure what happened . She was also told it was my birthday and she did take the amount of dessert off the bill . But I received no candle in my dessert, but  I did see other tables have candles in their birthday dessert.

The service was prompt, and the servers were friendly.  There was no wait to be seated as our reservation was for 5:30 PM.
When we left at 7:30 PM both the restaurant and bar area appeared to be full of people.  Great environment for a long chat with a friend.  Food was decent.   Would definitely go back and try something new.  Was not rushed out by staff even after 3 hours!   Super service!  My Old Fashioned was not good, steak was sub-par with gristle and little flavour.

Food was good. Yay!

Unfortunately, the pandemic-era glass dividers didn’t reduce our need to shout to hear each other and the perfunctory zero eye contact I’ve-mentally-moved-on-from-this-job server left my wife and I both feeling like we were an imposition on her precious time.

If you leave less than 5 stars on Open Table manager Michael will reference your previous reviews and treat you accordingly (poor service, hostile attitude, unaccommodating ). There is nothing WOW about the hospitality at Alena. Poor to the core. Mangers are the face of your company. Choose wisely. As a women, I felt very threatened by the male manager getting in my face and saying what he said. I’m appalled by his aggressive behaviour. For this reason I will never return. Now, I tell people Alena is “Wow!” For all the wrong reasons!! “Wow! They are bad! Id recommend they change their name to Yikes! Hospitality (don’t worry manager Michael, I’ll never return and tell local friends and family to avoid your restaurant as well)!! Ps.

Food was excellent. One of the best pizza crusts in the city. Staff were very attentive and welcoming. Will be back for sure!  Octopus salad was very nice and delicious. Garlic knots r always a nice simple starter. We have been back and will b back. Cheers.  A quaint little Italian restaurant. The grilled octopus special was excellent and we also enjoyed the grilled chicken, boar chops and Caesar salad. All were great. All servers were attentive and pleasant.

This is a lovely gem of a place that serves great food in a warm, cozy and relaxed atmosphere.  Had the mussels and focaccia to start.  Both were excellent with generous portions.

This was our 3rd time at Athena’s but the 1st time in 2024.   Unfortunately, the food this time was not good.  I had always understood a Caprese Salad was sliced tomato with a soft, fresh mozzarella cheese.  They served it with a few chunks of hard cheese - perhaps a mozzarella - not sure.  The pizza we shared was burnt on the bottom.  I mean charcoal burnt.  The outer edge portions were pretty much inedible.  We noted it to the server and she offered to take it back and have a new one prepared.  We told her no and just did not eat the charcoal portions.  What I found disappointing was that the kitchen would even let a pizza that burnt be served in the first place.  So may be a while before we go back. Read more  We had a good time. Nice ambiance. Overall the food was very good although my spaghetti carbonara was a little on the strong side. I wouldn’t order it again but would definitely go back and try something else on the menu.  Great ambiance and service. The food was good for the most part, however I would not recommend the Alena pizza. It had far too much garlic and arugula and not much of anything else! I took enough arugula off the pizza you make a salad for 2 people at least. That amount of arugula is not a pizza topping!

Great server  Mikela? Sorry if I’ve gotten your name wrong  This was my family’s first visit, and all of us (party of five) went away very happy. The food was great with very large portions (bigger than they needed to be, but that’s hardly a complaint) and something for everyone, and the drink selection is fun and offers variety. I was very impressed with the service - very personal, very caring, and despite some obvious issues at another table, we felt well cared for in what seemed a bit of a tough evening for the server. That shows well. The rain kept us off the patio, and we did find it a bit loud inside (especially once a bit of a boisterous group arrived), but noise level is subjective so take that as you will.

Our dining experience was a restaurant trying hard but but failing in many ways.
French Onion soup - average broth with low level cheese. Excellent garlic bread.
Our vegetarian member loved her power bowel.
Steak frites were poorly prepared. Just a seasonless piece of uncut beef.
Daily special chicken fajitas were a big miss. Just call them 3 luke warm chicken soft tacos. May need a lesson on what a fajita is.
Double Royal should have been a winner. Ordered as a deluxe. Not made as ordered. Could have been much better than made
We ordered a couple of diet cokes. They arrived with little to no carbonation and flavour that resembled tap water. We mentioned this to our server who apologized and informed us there wasn't anything that could be done. Offered and brought us canned Diet Coke. Awesome .... except they tasted even worse and had expired 11 months ago ! GROSS 🤮
Our server was disgusted as well
Guess what ?? Our bill arrived. Charged for our diet cokes as well as the deluxe up charge on the burger that never was made appropriately.

It was an ok experience, the waitress was busy most of the time.  Excellent kids menu with great value and perks!",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/25935312.webp

We are conveniently located near the University of Manaitoba as well as Investors Group Field!","It was my bday and it was a larger group. They did a good job at managing our table. Servers were friendly and attentive.  We we're there to watch the 2019 Grey Cup and the atmosphere was really great. The folks were not rowdy. The servers were also great, they know you are there to watch first and to eat second so they don't disturb you. The food was great and comes quick, and the place is clean  There was an incident when I first arrived. The waitresses asked me to choose which site of the restaurant I would like to sit in with my group. I answered that I need a location in which I can seat with the entire 12 people in my group. The waitresses directed me to the lounge section, she said I can sit with the entire people easily. I went to the lounge section only to be sent back to the receptionist. The waitresses at the lounge section told me that I have to sit on the restaurant section as I booked for that part. I was totally confused. This happened exactly about 5PM, which was my booking time.  Later I found out that apparently the waitresses on the restaurant section should have arranged a few tables together to fit 12 people per my booking, but they hadnt done that when I arrived. So about 5 minutes later finally I have the tables for 12 people in the restaurant section and all issues were resolved.
I hope the waitresses and waiters could have respected our advance booking and prepare the table(s) before my arrival in the future and avoid any unnecessary confusion.
The rest of the services went smoothly and promptly. We all enjoyed our food and beverages. The waitress for our tables was kindly enough to inform about happy hours drinks and the burger week menu as well as answering all other detailed questions about our orders. We were also allowed to do split bills which was convenient for all of us. Read more Food is very delicious especially the Pizza but the service is terrible  The food quality at this location is consistently excellent. The restaurant is compact and gets very noisy when it is full, especially with ‘energetic’ unsupervised children.

Waitress forgot to bring part of the order and we had to ask for it.

Surprised to find that fries and an ounce or so of gravy was almost $10.00. Read more Great location in our neighbourhood.

Me Mike's prices have gone up quite a bit and they have decreased their portion sizes on most meals. Service this time met our needs. Usually it is slow service even when there are not a lot of guests.

Our son likes the Mr Mikes burger so that is why we return but otherwise likely would not visit often given the pricing and smaller portion sizes. They even charge .50 cents if you want a bit of margarine to put on your rice that comes with your meal. That seems ridiculous to charge .50 cents plus taxes for a bit of margarine. No charge for Soy Sauce though. Read more We had the steak sandwich. The steak was tiny, there were insufficient fries and a few onion rings. It was quite expensive for the very small portion. The kids meal looked delicious and was enjoyed. the quessadilla platter looked good and a better value for your money.  My family goes to Mr Mikes for all special occasions because we love the food!!  Table was ready for our reservation,  food came fast, service was good.  Food was nothing special, temperature wasn’t great. Restaurant was very cold!  We used to love going here. Change of management didn't do it any favors...  Enjoyable dinner with quick friendly service. Will go again soon!  Great food , great service. Will definitely go back again ♡  We weren't happy with my husband's meal and when we told the server he didn't seem interested in offering any help.  My husband ordered the steak and lobster cream sauce.  The steak was so tough that it was noticeably hard to cut and was even worse to try and eat.  To the point that he never even finished half of his steak.  Not something we would ever order again for the money we paid.  Our bill was over 200.00 and if 1 out of the 4 meals were that bad was very disappointed that something wasn't done to compensate.  Not sure I would go back. Read more Read more Great food . Great place to treat yourself for a night out .  Lots of choices on the menu so something for all tastes. Staff at the door were very welcoming and serving staff explained the menu and answered any questions we had.  Food was prepared very quickly and we all enjoyed our meal. 
It was a bit noisy likely because there was a large group of youngish men right beside us  Valentines  It wasn’t bad",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/29788143.webp
