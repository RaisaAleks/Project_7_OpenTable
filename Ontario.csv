Good food and wine.   Very loud.  Not sure all the staff knew what their roles were.  Excellent service, food and ambiance. I’ll come back soon  Server Daryl was efficient, had good food recommendations, thoughtful - had complimentary cake and card for the birthday celebrant. Drinks were good for the happy hour and food was tasty! Excellent service! Thank you!  Avoid happy hours! Took them 37min to make us a pizza and the restaurant wasn’t even with half of their capacity. We even gave up on ordering a second one.  The food and service were excellent. The garlic bread and smashed potatoes are so good! I could eat them every day. The pastas were perfectly cooked and tasty. love this restaurant.  The food and decor are lovely, really good value for money and my group had a great time. They dim the lights around nightfall and it got really dark, a bit too dark and romantic for a work dinner as the candle in the middle casts very little light. But everything else was perfect, Great spot overall.  Very cool interior design and delicious food. Service was fantastic!  Thanks to Emma, for a lovely evening and great recommendations on the cocktails and banana pie dessert!  Excellent spot at “The Well”!  Food was great, interesting selections to choose from.
Espresso Martini not the greatest.  Actually was a really pleasant surprise dining here. Not that I expected badly, but it’s always nice to pick a random restaurant to try and have it exceed expectations. I came with my friend and we had the duck main platter, beet salad, fried polenta, and tuna crudo. These were super filling and delicious. The portions were quite generous. flavours AMAZING. The duck and the crudo were our favourites but everything was tasty.

Service was good and dishes came out at a good pace.

The portion size was perfect, and I felt like we got good value.  Our server was very good, offering some recommendations for food choices and specials.  Terroni Price is always my favorite restaurant for great Italian dishes and the staff create such an upbeat atmosphere!  Consistently delicious food. Service can be a bit ""distracted"" because they get very busy...but they are busy for a reason. Delicious food.  Food was good.
We were sat on the main floor instead of upstairs which was disappointing. Extremely loud hard to hear and not a relaxing dining experience for an anniversary. We did mention that when booking also in the app. The lights in the shelving niche were way too bright for someone sitting across from them as they were harsh and put the person in front of them in shadow.
Appetizers came right away but Very slow timing for mains it was too busy and felt the kitchen was having a hard time keeping up.

Highly recommend for a very good Italian meal. with friends or faimily. Read more Wow. This was the last time I eat at Terroni. Food was cold, service was awful and somehow we still managed to spend $$$$.

Competition is now fierce in the neighbourhood. No longer a good default restaurant  First time at this location. It looked fairly small from the street, but it is huge! Our server was very friendly and attentive. Cocktails delicious and strong. Food as good as the Adelaide location, which is my regular. My only complaint is that the music is horrible. Crappy, bass-laden techno crap. Maybe that’s the in thing now or maybe I’m getting old but it was loud and unnecessary.  It won’t keep me away but it could be so much better ambiance-wise. The perfectly Al dente pasta will bring me back though. Read more Staff truly tries. My favourite location of their restaurants.  We love the food at Terroni’s at Price, but why is it always so noisy?

We think the restaurant should seriously think about investing in some sound buffers for the 2nd floor dining area.  My friend and I hadn't seen each other for a few years and was a catch up dinner. He had a beer and I enjoyed a negroni. We both had Pappardella... he had the special Funghi (all mushrooms) and I had the Iosa (sausage). I have had this dish several times and this time there wasn't enough sauce. Our server didn't bring us fresh pepper, parmasean cheese. I was going to order a glass of wine with my dinner, but he never came back to ask. It wasn't that busy, so not sure. Then was asked if wanted dessert, we both declined.

Live music but perfect volume. Service was excellent.  Ambiance is amazing ! Few key points, esp with an upscale restaurant like this, a firmer dress code would be nice as seeing people in their sweats changes the experience esp when I put and effort with my fit . The cocktails are phenomenal ! The steaks were amazing ! My porter house is perfect ! The peas with the lamb needs to be pureed but the lamb itself is delicious. the beef tartare is amazing !

You won’t be disappointed when you choose Hy’s!!  Shannon was by far the best waitress I have had in a very long time.  About the time my glass was down to the last couple of sips, she would magically appear and refill it.  The food was fabulous and music in the bar was really great.  Definitely will head back there when I come back to Toronto.  Excellent food, lovely atmosphere and attentive service.  Had a wonderful experience at Hy Steakhouse. They were very accommodating and staff made great efforts to entertain our little ones. Food was great! We really enjoyed everything.  We waited 10 minutes after seating for a waiter to arrive.  He was very nice but by that point my son and I started to feel like Paris because the other tables were getting the type of service we have gotten in the past.  The steaks were good but not great.  We both had Rib Eye’s and mine was a touch undercooked (I asked for medium rare) making some parts of the steak tough and chewy.  Was it horrible, no they were good steaks but for the money I expect perfection.  We did not get it.  Restaurant was also quite loud, not really like the experience at their old location.   We won’t be going back.  Desserts were good, I have to give them that but that’s not why you go to Hy’s.  While I am it we ordered the Caesar salad and split it.  It was ok but the portions were a bit short and croutons scarce.  Not what I expected. Read more Really nice! Good food, good service. Good location.

The sea bream was cooked to perfection and the octopus was the most tender we’ve had. The preparations and presentation were unique but appropriate.
Service was genuinely friendly, helpful but unobtrusive.
Highly recommend ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Read more My party of 3 were early by 45 mins and we
were gracefully accommodated.  Booked dinner at Abrielle for anniversary dinner with wife. While food was outstanding, service was extremely slow, with us waiting for almost an hour till appetizers arrived (raw tuna and burrata). Forty-five minutes after appetizers arrived, our entrees (ravioli and sea bream) finally arrived. No checking in from waitress for updates on the food, and when entrees initially came, wrong order arrived (ten minutes wait after that). No comps made for wait and service, no acknowledgement made regarding our anniversary (note was made for reservation). Initially had planned to order dessert as well, however given prolonged wait time, decided against.

For the price point and reputation of restaurant based off online reviews, I expected more. Will not come again, do not recommend. Read more Meals are excellent but small, it’s expensive but the food is very good. It got a little too noisy at the end of the night.  Chef Experience option for the meal was fantastic. Service and atmosphere was bang on!  Good food and ambience but very slow service. Our reservation was for 7:30p and our food was slow to come out. By 10:10p we still hadn't received our dessert. Our party ended up leaving early without it because we had been waiting a while and had an early start the following day.  I only write reviews when it’s really necessary, in this case it is , I went to this restaurant with a group of 6 people , we order some appetizers including some oysters , we waited almost 30 minutes and they didn’t bring the oysters to the table , so we had to ask them they apologize making up very bad excuses like they were short of staff , you just need to open the oysters anyway , after the waitress gave the option to cancel my order if I wanted too , so we canceled , they brought the main course and it was so disappointing, I ordered half a chicken with mushrooms very simple and forgettable , for the place and price I was expecting much more.
The rest of my family order different things like ravioli, fish and octopus  we all agreed that the food was very plain , not too much flavour , very pricey for what they serve not worth your money . Read more Food and presentation  was excellent. Kitchen was slammed so timing wasn’t great but they make up for it in service and attentiveness. Overall a great dining experience we will definitely do again.  Exceptional food and the waiters were very pleasant and efficient.  The food was good, but not worth the price tags imo. The flatbread was so tasty and fresh. Whipped eggplant was bland and fell short. The mushrooms croquettes was delish. Roasted brocollini was yummy but the lemon sauce it sat on top of was reminiscent of a melted citronella candle. It was SO intense. Do not take even a small dab of the sauce on its own.
Ambience was lovely until 8pm when they started BLASTING EDM music. Everyone was still eating dinner and it was hard to hear each other. This is more of a 9pm-10pm move. Decor was cutesy. I recommend the bar side, more ambient lighting. Our server was awesome and perfectly on time and not annoying. She came by the perfect amount of times. Water glasses always filled which I love.

We had a great time and food was excellent  Arrived on time for reservation. Seated and waited 5-6 mins for server. Had to ask for water and menus. Server was trying to help with specialized food order. Order taken and not actually submitted for over 10 mins. (Server came back with questions prior to sending in order). Appetizer took 20 mins to arrive and kitchen got the order wrong. Entreé was another 45 mins after finishing appetizer. Meal (chicken club sandwich) was flavourless, cold with mushy fries. With only 10 mins left to eat I asked for the bill to be brought right away as it had been 1 hour & 50 mins since arriving and we had to leave for a show. Bill took 10 mins to arrive.  Over priced for what we received. Server was friendly and polite. A man in a suit working there (manager/supervisor?) was often walking around with almost an angry look on his face. Didn’t look approachable to ask for help with service.  No discount offered for the delays. Read more The start of the evening was good, got our drinks and food within an hour of being there. After that it had a sharp decline. No one came to our table at all, for about an hour and a half after we got our entrees. No water top up, nothing. The entire dinner took 3 & 1/2 hours, which seems exceptionally long for a dinner.  This restaurant is one of my favorites. The food is amazing, and the service is prompt and attentive.  We were in Toronto few a few days.  I used this app. Looked at the menu and made a reservation. Food was excellent. But the server was amazing. Her name was Emma. I don’t often remember names. But she stood out like a star. Polite caring and wanting very much to please. We loved every moment we enjoyed ourselves. We live in Las Vegas, severs could learn a lesson. We loved Emma. Please thank her from us. Read more Food was pretty good. Gluten free crust was soggy and under cooked. Great looking food though, prompt service, but our waitress didn't know much. Said she didn't eat fish when asking about the sushi. And wasn't sure if there were nuts in a dish. Overall, pretty good if ordering off the happy hour menu (before 5)  The atmosphere was an elegant blend of modern chic and cozy warmth, with soft lighting that created an inviting yet sophisticated vibe. The decor, understated yet stylish, added to the overall charm—perfect for both intimate dinners and special celebrations.
The service, too, deserves a mention. The staff were attentive without being overbearing, offering insightful suggestions and ensuring that we were well taken care of throughout the evening. They created a welcoming environment that made the meal all the more enjoyable. Read more We went to celebrate my birthday but unfortunately the kitchen had an issue and the fire truck came.

The intimate lighting and modern music created a relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere. If I lived in Toronto, I would make it a regular spot for dining.

The service was excellent. I was indecisive between two appetizers, but the server kindly suggested I try half portions of both at half the price, which was a brilliant solution. The scallop starter was outstanding, thanks to the freshness of the ingredients, while the lobster dish was also superb.

The dessert was a delightful conclusion to the meal. I would have loved to pair it with a glass of Umeshu (Japanese plum wine), which is commonly available in Montreal restaurants. Despite this, the overall experience—from the beautifully designed space to the attentive service—was flawless.

Sat outside in October and all was perfect. Service exceptional and food terrific.  Great food and service.  Lovely brunch, food was great, server was really good and fun. Love this place  Steak tartare was good. Half chicken was a great recommendation. Beautiful patio. Our server Fasal was amazing!  The service was very attentive and the food was served very quickly. It was delicious and the staff were very hospitable from start to finish. Two of us were gluten free and the staff was very conscientious to ensure our needs were met. Highly recommend.  We were seated outside, which saved us from the somewhat noisy bar and cafe. The large and more agreeable inside restaurant was reserved for a private function.

Do not sit on the side tables outside on the commercial walkway perpendicular to the street unless you’re comfortable with passersby close to your table separated by a railing. And occasional whiffs of cannabis.

The food was good, particularly a generous slab of branzino. The spaghetti squash with feta and honey and pumpkin seeds was a great vegetarian choice, in need of more feta. Beef looked overpriced.

The menu is short and there is something for every taste. Next time I may do two starters.

Service was ok and we were on the side. Server was trying to upsell the more expensive options.

As everywhere else in Ontario, wine was overpriced. The Ontario chardonnay was tasty and a good option. Read more Peach and tomato salad excellent, bucatini all'amatriciana also fantastic  Great experience with fantastic food and top notch service.

The fritto misto for example was predominantly fried zucchini and carrots with a few scattered pieces of fish for $25. Drinks are unbelievably priced but I guess that’s just Toronto. Service was also strange, our waitress actually approached our table after we’d paid the bill asking if we wanted to order dessert. This was very jarring and we couldn’t tell if this was to urge us to leave, or if she’d genuinely forgot about us paying already (which had happened 5 minutes prior). It didn’t seem very friendly as we were celebrating a graduation (there were flowers on the table - indicating it was some special event) and the waitress didn’t even ask if we were celebrating, just for conversation’s sake. The food was also extremely salty and again, not worth the price. I usually come here for lunch and have found the downstairs eatery very enjoyable but the upstairs restaurant was really a poor experience. Read more Overall good experience, but the table are way too close to each other, it was really hard to hear the other person  Very conveniently located within walking distance of Mirvish on Victoria for a post theatre meal.

When unsure about our wine choice, the sommelier/general manager came to our table with a great suggestion and stopped by again later to ensure we were happy with our choice.  Long Italian wine list broken down by region and delicious pasta dishes. Clearly a happy place to work. Good vibes. Will definitely be back. Read more Fine, O.K., nothing off the charts.  Downtown expensive, not unexpected in the downtown core but you are always hoping to hit a gem when paying high prices.  My sister and I had lunch for her birthday at Sud forno. The hostess waited waitress were all lovely!
I had the bufalotta pizza, it was alright- I’ll give it credit for the portion size - enough for two! My sister had cavatelli zucchine e zafferano, not bad either. The highlight was the appetizer- we shared fritto misto.  We found it strange that there were no diet pop options as we wanted something with no sugar other than water.  Our visit premised on other reviews fell well below expectations. Our appetizer arrived promptly after ordering along with our carafe of wine however it took about an hour to receive our mains. Not sure who screwed up either the waiter or kitchen. Unbelievable! We had to ask for a manager who apologized and only charged us for the wine. No second chances when do many other restaurants are nearby. Read more Food was delicious, but our pizza was cool….as though it had sat waiting to be brought to our table. The restaurant wasn’t busy, so not sure why. Although we never do this, we informed the server and she had the kitchen prepare another one. It was hot and delicious. Likewise our coffee and tea were lukewarm when they arrived. Having eaten at other Terroni restaurants we were disappointed, but will visit Sud Forno another time in case it was just an off evening for our server. Read more I've only eaten at two Terroni restaurants-one many years ago and another earlier this summer.

So when she arrived in Toronto, that's where we went. 

We were very impressed with the ambience, the decor and the service.  The food was excellent.  I had the halibut and my daughter had the spaghetti bolognese.  Both were so tasty.

It's a must in the City.  The wagyu tartare was so delicious and well-seasoned, the prime rib roast was cooked to a perfect doneness, and the roasted potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The Thanksgiving dessert special was also very tasty. Overall, I was very happy with my meal.  Delicious food however the restaurant was very noisy. It was difficult to have a conversation while enjoying the meal. It wasn’t just us, I noticed that other tables also did not engage in conversations. That ruins the outside dining experience for me.  I dined at The Dorset for their Thanksgiving special roast. My companions, one vegetarian, ordered from the traditional Sunday menu. The food was very good, presented beautifully. The vegetarian offering was limited (they did have a few cauliflower based items that were quite tasty) but this is not a spot I would recommend as highly vegetarian-friendly.

The entire ambiance and dining experience is exceptional - felt very high-end but relaxed. The design of the restaurant is superb, although the climb up the stairs was a bit more than we bargained for.

Will definitely be returning. Great meal. Great experience. Read more Fantastic service and fantastic food. Would highly recommend!  It was my first time visiting Dorset. It was very lovely. Highly recommended. The food was 10/10 especially fish and chips. It stayed crispy until we finish the dish. Also the steak was cooked perfectly. It was melting in my mouth. I would love to come back for other dishes I didn't try.  Food was ok, but I wasn’t really impressed. I won’t be back.  Great Thanksgiving Dinner at the Dorset, dinner had a British flair, presentation and quality were amazing, great value, service was top notch, a very enjoyable dinner.  The food was really great but service wasn’t the best.  However, we did talk to a manager who really listened to our concerns and apologized.  We had the Dorset burger, fish and chips, salmon, and halibut. We also had the wagyu Tartar for appetizers. The fish and chips were very good, as was the burger. Salmon and halibut dishes a bit smaller in portion for the price point.

The wagyu tartare rated highly online, but personally it was only so-so. I have had better regular beef tartare without paying the extra for wagyu here.

We expected to see well - behaved waitress in compare to the price you pay for such restaurants.  Really great food and exceptional service. Would highly recommend this restaurant.

There were three of us, and two ordered the steak with eggs, but both dishes arrived cold. When we informed the staff, they took one plate back and returned it after the other person had already finished their meal. To make matters worse, they only replaced the eggs and served the same steak!

We ordered the broccolini to come out with our mains but our mains came out 30 minutes after the broccolini. The waitress apologized and had one of the mains compensated because they went to the wrong table at first which was very nice I know it wasn’t her fault. However after our mains were dropped off no one asked how our food was, no one checked in on us.

The option to add chicken to pasta would be nice. Service was excellent.  Great food and customer service, would definitely come again for their Cacio E Pepe!  Noise level was off putting. Need to turn volume down further.  If you want to wait an hour for pasta come here! Server was pretty lukewarm and dry. When we first arrived I was having a bit of difficulty understanding the menu, so like most normal people I asked for suggestions and he replied saying “stay in school” I was confused and offended at the same time. Moving along, we ordered non alcoholic drinks which I think were over priced for what we received. $10 for a very average strawberry lemonade. For appetizers we ordered stracciatella which was pretty much cheese and sourdough bread. Again not worth the money. It came with a large portion of the cheese spread and only 3 pieces of sourdough bread. I had to pretty much beg for another slice for our table since there was 4 of us, at first our waiter explained that we’d have to pay extra but finally was able to bring out 1 additional slice of bread. Of course we finished and were still left with a lot of cheese spread. For $24 dollars it would be nice to actually eat and enjoy your ENTIRE appetizer. Lastly, we waiting a little over an HOUR for a very simple pasta. I did observe other patrons who arrived earlier who were some how able to get their food way before us. Overall terrible experience. I love dining downtown however I will not be returning here or recommending this place to any friends/family. So many other Italian restaurants that are worth your money and offer better service.

Food was okay and service was good.  There was an odd smell as soon as you walked in; almost like you mopped with unclean water or used dirty rags to whip things down.  A stale, musty odour.  Lots of flies buzzing around … it made you immediately wonder about cleanliness. 

The service was odd .. our main serve was non-attentive but yet multiple different staff kept coming to ask if we were doing okay.  Ultimately a very nice gentleman came to take our order … 5 min later our main server came to ask us what we wanted to order.  A third person then came to ask us about our food after it was served.  A very odd experience - you can’t complain about not being waited on but it did feel like you were starting from the beginning with each new person coming to the table. 

The food was fine but overpriced for that it was … the scallop appetizer was $23 for two scallops sliced in half to make it look like 4; very disappointing.  The drinks were filled to the brim with ice even though they were $15-20; again, overpriced and disappointing.

Also, while the tables are well suited for shareable appetizers,  we found the tables too large to share intimate conversation amongst ourselves. we were so distant from one another, and the noise level was so loud, our party struggled to hear one another.

It’s a beautiful venue. We went to celebrate our anniversary and we got seated next to the waiter’s station which wasn’t a good seat but they did move us to a better seat. It’s expensive … but then everything in Toronto is expensive. The markup on wine is crazy … sure they are special wines from Greece … but none of the wines on the menu justify the costs. The fish is prepared nicely, the octopus was great but the rest of the appetizers and sides were ok … not worth the price. My yiayia prepares a better gigantes with more flavour.

Server at first was attentive, but this quickly declined as the restaurant became busier as the night went on. We arrived at 8:30pm on Monday Sept 30 and did not expect it to be as loud or as busy as it was. I think our server was the only staff member working, as I noticed he was serving many tables outside of the area we were in. This is not the server's fault; rather, it may have been overlooked by the restaurant management of how busy they were going to be on a Monday night and they were likely understaffed(?). Towards the end of our evening, we requested for the dessert menus and we were ready to order; however, our server was visibly busy cashing out other tables in a distant area. We were waiting for 13 minutes to order dessert, and by that point, we decided to forego the dessert and get the bill and leave. We tried to flag our server down but he was busy (understandably). I went to the host stand and found a woman in a light blue blouse and glasses who was able to cash us out. This is not our first time at Terroni; however, it is unfortunate that what was once a great experience, is now dampened by the unfortunate service we had (out of the control of the server).

Excellent service, delicious food!  Myself and my husband went for brunch. 

We ordered:
Baklava pancakes 
Patates arnaki 
Spanakopita florentine 

Everything was amazing, so much flavour. I told my husband it’s become my new favourite brunch place. The service was great and she coursed it out for us. 

I highly recommend. I would love to try for dinner next Read more Nice atmosphere but way overpriced for meagre portions.   Yes, it is meant to be small plates but two shrimp for $18?  You're joking.  Overall the food and service were excellent!  the servers went out of their way to ensure that we received the wine we liked best. Servers were attentive and friendly.  
The various small plates we tasted were all delicious. The bread and honey butter with bee pollen a standout!  Service was quick and attentive. The food quite tasty but the noise level of the music was so loud that my dining partner and I have sore throat’s the day after from yelling at each other for 2 hours. That just destroyed any good feelings about the restaurant  Loved Koukla! Staff was super friendly, our waitress rushed to let us know we only had a few minutes to order our wine if we wanted to benefit from the 50% off promo until 19h30. We didn't know about the promotion before going there, so it was very thoughtful to let us know!! 
Every little plate was delicious, we had the octopus, eggplant dip, lamb kefta, calamari and beef. Each of them were 100% and the sparkling wine we had was AMAZING.
We sat at the bar, saw the chefs working and plating the food = perfect Saturday night. Read more Great bar, patio is quite nice. Wine was delicious and Rachel was a great host.  The service was pretty bad. There was so music or vibe, we sat on the patio. It was my birthday and it said so in the reso and the server never mentioned a thing about it.  Wow, what a great brunch! Portions are perfect, and the quality of food is outstanding. Sat on the patio, which was very pleasant. Will definitely be coming back!  There were six of us for dinner.  Every dish we tasted was excellent!   The small plates were the perfect way for us to enjoy several different dishes.

The food was great!

Thanks!!! Read more I had a lovely time at the King West location, however I do feel the noise (mostly the music) was a little bit too loud. It made it difficult to have conversation over dinner.  Went to this newly opened location with some friends for dinner. The service with our waiter was ""ok"", nothing special. Rather than being attentive and talking with the whole table as a conversationalist, it seemed he was more attentive and interested in talking with the attractive women around us and at our table, which I don't think was appropriate. When we arrived, we saw staff members giving people free champage/wine and after being seated and asking about it, our same waiter said ""they give it to the hot girls"" and looked at my friend and said ""you're hot too so i will bring you one"". I just don't think from a business standpoint, that this is appropriate. However, the food was good (had a steak and dozen oysters) and the coconut mango margarita. This margarita was delicious.

Overall a memorable experience to help us celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary. (Note: we had our wedding reception there in 2021) Thanks Oretta!  The server took a long time to serve us, the food was not what I expected, the atmosphere inside the restaurant was very cold and she didn't ask us for the tip, she charged the full amount.

The lasagna bianca with bechemel sauce had next to no bechemel in it.  And it was dried out - not at all moist or flavorful.  The avacado appetizer was very good.  Service was fine.

Service and ambiance were fine, we were seated at the front end of the restaurant which looked different from the back portion- it was much more casual.

Like our last visit, we enjoyed the appetizers very much, the salmon, tuna, and mulhwe made it worth the visit for sure. 

We had tried a ssam platter and the pork belly mid course last time and we felt both were a bit lacking so decided to just try the mushroom jook just to give those courses one more shot. The appetizers are so tasty and well-balanced that it’s a bit of a bummer having anything after it. The jook really is like a homemade jook. It tasted just fine but given the price, I had expected tastier mushrooms than cremini and bits of maitake. This gripe is just a preference but it left a lot to be desired for me.

We first imagined Aloette to be the perfect diner that we’d want to dine in – a menu with a great cheeseburger paired with a fantastic and fun wine list, a long row of bar stools facing the bar and the kitchen, and an energetic atmosphere accented with an old school hip hop playlist. The buzz of the dining room mirrors the energy of the street on Spadina Avenue; the dining room itself mimics a train’s dining car. It’s a bistro-meets-diner-meets-internationally-inspired menu which is also representative of the diverse culture in Toronto. Our service team is upbeat and genuine but also deeply knowledgeable about the menu and offerings.

Brunch at Aloette was something we said we’d never do. But the city kept asking and we’re glad to be a new staple in the Queen West neighbourhood for mimosas, chicken and waffles, and piping hot coffees.

We hope you love our little diner as much as we and our team do.

The ambiance was cozy and perfect for group dining, with comfortable seating and gentle background music that allowed for easy conversation.

We started with the eggplant appetizer, which was the highlight of the meal for me – rich in flavor and perfectly prepared. The tiramisu, while tasty, was softer than expected, possibly from being in the fridge too long. However, the rest of the dishes were served fresh and delicious.

We came in the afternoon and cibo was well-lit, spacious and open. I’d definitely recommend cibo for a little afternoon lunch or a cheeky date night. Read more CIBO,a restaurant that promises the allure of Italian sophistication, ultimately left me with an experience I can only describe as a textbook example of how style can overshadow substance. From the moment I stepped in,the atmosphere radiated with a sense of expectation—starting off strong with a flavourful wine aperitif,it was unfortunate that the anticipation quickly dissolved with each course.The lasagna, an iconic Italian dish that usually marries rich,hearty flavors,arrived tepid and tragically lacking in both seasoning and depth.Rather than a robust combination of ingredients,it tasted as if each layer was an afterthought, as though someone had forgotten the essence of what makes lasagna a beloved dish—flavor. It left me wanting, searching for even the faintest hint of seasoning that might justify its existence on the menu.Then came the lobster ravioli. While the pasta itself was well-executed, the filling carried an unpleasant fishiness that overwhelmed the palate. Lobster, when prepared well, should be delicate, sweet, and nuanced. But here,it was masked by an over-salted sauce that did little to enhance the dish, instead working as a blunt instrument that left me reaching for water after each bite.Despite the warm demeanor of the waitstaff, their service was alarmingly slow.Plates were left abandoned on the table long after we had finished, an oversight that,in a setting with such high prices, was particularly galling. The lack of attentiveness, combined with the subpar food, compounded the disappointment. For a meal priced just shy of $300, the experience was, quite frankly, unacceptable. It felt more like a betrayal of the Italian culinary tradition than a celebration of it. For that reason, I am left with no choice but to rate this experience a disheartening 2 out of 5 stars.

I was there for a friends birthday dinner and we tried their scallop crudo, beef tartare, rapini, octopus feature, and duck confit pasta.

The scallop crudo was not very well balanced and found that it was over seasoned and the only two things we could really taste were the onions and the salt. We did not get any of the yuzu and the scallop felt like it was fighting for some show time, and losing.

The beef tartare was descent, but the toast that it came with was more exciting. The horseradish flavour was light but it tasted like it was filled with mayo.

The octopus dish was a lot of fun, and we only wished that the octopus was cooked slightly less well done (it was starting to get tough).

Rapini was overcooked and over-seasoned with salt and parm. We struggled to taste the vegetable and the texture was starting to get very soft.

The pasta was incredible though and I would come back to try their other pastas.

Service was excellent and quick. I just wish the food was not so over seasoned and over cooked. Read more Excellent martini and garlic cheesy bread. Pastas were delicious. Cozy back covered patio.

My octopus was excellent. Pasta was good. Great variety of wines. It ended well with their cheese platter and an Italian almond-lemon (in this order) torta.  The ambiance in this place is fabulous, and service is always great. I do find the portions disappointing for the price, however, the taste is great. We ordered a special (potato agnolotti), cheesy pull apart bread which were both fantastic. I ordered the Cacio e Pepe crown which was good, but quite lemon-y and didn't have the traditional cheesy taste (in my opinion). Blueberry sorbet and lemon torte for dessert were both a delight.

Had the Thanksgiving turkey meal, which was very good and an excellent value. Always like sitting on the patio a very relaxed atmosphere will definitely be back.  A lovely thanksgiving set menu at Hamingway's, at their heated rooftop terrace.  Great for thanksgiving dinner but did not receive any points  I was messaging their social media, who confirmed that they would be showing the 2 WXV rugby games that night, which convinced me to make reservations. 

We arrive there, and the staff seemed like they weren't even aware that there were games on that night. The first game had already started by the time they were able to put in on a screen NOT visible from our table, so then they made us move tables after we had already ordered, even though we specifically asked for/booked a table with a good view of the games in the first place. So then we finally had the game showing, but there was absolutely no sound throughout the game. Nobody came to check if that was okay. 

For the second game, once again it seemed like they weren't aware (and even the person on the chat originally thought it was the next day), and we also needed to ask for it to be put on screen again. There was another table beside us that was also there for the rugby, but we all had to watch the first few minutes of the match on our phones because NOBODY from the staff was in any particular hurry to fix the problem. You'd think Canada being in the tournament final would be something they'd care a little more about.

Again, we made reservations to come here SPECIFICALLY because we were told by the person on the chat that they were aware of and would be showing both games. We could have easily stayed home to watch the games (with sound) and have drinks and food in the living room, but chose to go out for a more lively and social ambiance. Unfortunately, it turns out that they don't actually care about rugby and rugby fans, much less when it's women's/Canadian rugby.

The staff pretending there wasn't something particularly wrong with the situation was also nice, though I'd like to think that Marty might humbly disagree or even found a better solution.

The lobster pasta special was impeccable, the creaminess of the tomalley mixed into the tomato based cheese sauce was amazing. The flavours were robust yet subtley pleasing. The pasta was done to al dente perfection. The gnudi was soft with ripples of crunch from the grains of semolina, bathed in a rich creamy mushroom sauce.

It used to be a place for a high-end night out. While we were there we saw male guests in basketball shorts and tanktops. Seeing other diners underarm hair certainly takes away from the atmosphere.

The lobster salad is so delicious and lots of lobster. Lamb excellent and the pear tart tatin amazing. Great service and such a nice fun team. Really good cooking at a decent price.

The food was good, service great , but what ruined the experience was the announcements that were broadcast of an electrical outage that was to occur during that week. This really spoiled the ambience for both my partner and I
The decor was really tired as well.

Cute for a regular date night or for a night out with the girls. So pretty for pictures and the food was really good just prepare to spend a lot of money.  This used to be my favourite restaurant but yesterday’s experience had been extremely disappointing and distasteful. Upon arrival, as we sat down, the host approached us and said the Manager Nader had asked my friend to remove his hat but we glanced around and a gentleman was wearing a hat by the bar and he clearly had been sitting there for a while and we asked why was he wearing a hat and he had to take his off. She then approached Nader, the manager who was hiding by the bar in the corner what we had said. He then approached the gentleman by the bar to remove his hat afterwards. If this was an issue then he would have asked the gentleman to remove his hat already when he walked in but it’s clear that he knew the gentleman so he allowed him to wear his hat in the first place and because he had asked him to remove it, he then went to approach the other patron wearing his hat. I have also been to this restaurant with a friend wearing a hat before and no one had said anything about him taking his hat off. The manager had sat down with a female and a male and the female was wearing sweat pants and brought her Yorkie dog to eat at the table and walked around the restaurant with holding her dog passing through the food preparation area which is considered unsanitary but certain people aren’t allowed to wear hats at the table. But the whole kitchen staff were wearing hats. The contradiction. Make it make sense. The food quality had went down a lot from the other times I have went to Maxime’s. It tasted a lot better before. We had requested to speak to Nader but he did not approach our table. My friend is black and he felt he was discriminated by the manager. Avoid this place at all cost if you want good customer service. The server was kind. But this place either needs a new manager who knows how to manage an upscale restaurant and not be discriminatory and egotistical.

We ordered the black cod and I pulled 10 bones out of it which shouldn't happen with a $50 price tag.  The lamb chops were dry and small.  You didn't have many vegetable options but we ordered the eggplant.  You didn't have eggplant so we ordered broccoli since the server said it would be grilled on the flame.  It was not.  It was hard not crispy and sitting in sauce that tasted bad.  My husband can make better broccoli.  After that we decided to skip desert.  The whole meal was overpriced for the quality.  I think things have definitely slipped. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/60625437.webp

To whom this may concern,
First and foremost, I booked a table for six at 2 PM for brunch or lunch that was posted on open table. Also did my friend Arianna who booked for 2:30 PM. When I tried to call, it told me I have to do everything through open table. There is no phone number to reach any human to talk directly to that works at the restaurant. So I had sent an email I got no reply. That was the first red flag for me. So when I book on open table, it asked me do you want high tea or do you want regular service? I opted for regular service. Coming up to my reservation I confirmed and also did my friend Ariana. There was no information on my reservation that there was construction going on in front of the hotel or in there. It was hard to get parking. It was not told in advance and we couldnt find restaurant parking. Try to call the restaurant. That’ll be no answer cause I couldn’t get hold of them, my friend restaurant reservation and they tell you guys it’s only service when I google the restaurant, the hour of operation don’t match what is on open table. So that was very confusing for my guest and I. Arianna and I booked this restaurant to celebrate our birthday weeeks in advance. I was highly disappointment with the staff and the miscommunication they had with their manager and not even knowing of the reservations. When we finally get there they’re telling me they don’t do breakfast or brunch at this time it ends at 11 am, and again that’s not what is posted here in open table. Oh how their lunch start at 3 pm and there’s only high tea. I was so furious because it’s cutting into my birthday plans. Not only was it an arm and a leg to find the place, now I’m hungry and you’re telling me only tea and biscuits?! That’s so infuriating. I did not end up celebrating my birthday there. I went else where with my guest because clearly your establishment falsely advertised, were not well equipped or informed to even serve my guest and I. 
I definitely will not be back. Read more The afternoon tea was fabulous. Definitely will go back to enjoy it again.  10/10 Recommend! Incredible! 
It was a Tues night before a show and this place was beautiful, and peaceful which was needed after our travels. Background music added a soothing ambiance and the food was 10/10 and exceeded my hopes. We were greeted graciously and invited to choose our seating. Our Chef served us our meal which was special. 

My shrimp starter was hearty and delightful with grilled pineapple, red pepper and mango. Mom was sure it was the Best Burger she'd ever had. The whole experience was ideal and memorable! I give it 5 stars across the board.

Food was too salty for my liking for what we ordered, overall if the food wasn’t too salty for my liking but the quality of the food is high.  Our server was very attentive, provided us with the best wine based on our preferences and connected with us well. The olives were great and the wine was even better!  Always great food at Paris, Paris. An energetic vibe, so if you are looking for quiet romance , this is not the place. Service was a bit slow (understaffed perhaps?)  Love the food - I forgot my waiter’s name but he wore glasses he was very helpful and kind to our crazy group. 10/10  Busy Saturday night but the food and service were meh. Food came out quickly (and all at once which I would have preferred to be paced). But then no one checked on us for an hour. Tomato salad was strange tasting and very soggy. Neither of us enjoyed the charcuterie meats. Foie gras was also underwhelming. All the food was fine. We left 70% of our food untouched.

Though we’d done our homework by checking out the menu and pics of the place beforehand, we were pleasantly surprised at how much nicer it looked in person. In all honesty, I’d doubt you could find a bad seat anywhere in there. And for anyone reading this who might not be sure as to how to dress for this place, it has the same feel and atmosphere as a Joeys or O&B, so come as you are, dressed up or dressed down. I’d just advise against shorts, ripped jeans or any pants that might say something to the effect of “juicy” across the butt. I know you’re hungry and want to get your drink on, but let’s keep it classy.

The service was good and our server was attentive (although it was a quiet lunch service on the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend, so I don’t feel it was an accurate reflection of the quality of service).

Generally speaking, the food was good, although, despite the nice chunks of lobster in my classic lobster roll, with a healthy amount of flavour, the bread was tasteless. Sorry kitchen staff, it was. I gauge all lobster rolls I order by the ones I’ve eaten in Florida, which are by far the best you can get outside of Cape Cod, and while there’s no skimping on the lobster filling at the Lobster Burger Bar, once I’d eaten all that, the bread was a huge disappointment. Truly tasteless.

As well, while my gin & tonic was totally on the money, so my hat’s off to the bar staff.

All that aside, customers, please do not be discouraged by the negatives on my review. My wife asked me twice if I’d come back, and she got a resounding yes both times. I only hope management reads this so they can make the prescribed adjustments. Read more On e they realized we were there they were terrific  The food wasn’t bad, I’ve definitely had better of everything I ordered. Got the calamari, lobster roll, lobster Mac and cheese, and the lobster cakes. Out of all things the lobster roll was the most disappointing, as it’s why I came here in the first place. Nonetheless, food wasn’t terrible just not to what was expected. It was empty when we went for dinner, maybe because it was late, but I assumed on a Friday night it would have been much busy. Staff was decent. Read more Great ambiance .  Prices wre reasonable. The food eas average.  Nachos had melted cheese whiz. It was not great.   Other offerings wre great.   Soup and lobster Roll was awesome  The staff is young, attractive and eager to please. The food is very good and reasonably priced which makes it worth going back for. The service is excellent and attentive.  Definitely recommend especially if one is going to the theatre or symphony.  Mediocre. Was a good location for pre theatre lunch.  I visited this spot with a group of friends before heading to a show, and it was incredible from start to finish! The Lobster Rolls and Lobster Bisque were out of this world, and the Lobster Gravy with Fries was equally mouthwatering. To top it off, we were treated to complimentary tequila shots and the most delicious tiramisu for dessert. Every bite was DELISH!!

Dessert did not disappoint either, chocolate pot was the winner from the two personally. Always an amazing time at the Rabbit Hole!  The app was over salted (rabbit on a crumpet) - they comp’d this and that was nice. My Mahi Mahi was so over cooked I could not eat it - the skin was burnt to the point it tasted rancid. My wife had the salmon and it was also over cooked to the point of being dry. We let the staff know and they apologized. We would not go back to this restaurant.

The games give us a great full night too.  Ther service was excellent, the kids enjoyed the arcade, but the quality of food was poor. You need to do better with quality of ingredients for taste, textures flavour .. would definitely come back for the arcade only, but until the quality of food does massively better, I’ll choose another place to eat first  the food is pretty average for the price we pay for  Several tables including ours sat uncleared for almost 30 minutes  Food wasn't great, Overpriced for what we ordered. The service was terrible and the drinks were inconsistent  Great atmosphere and great location, but the food was not the greatest. The kids meals pizza was atrocious. The cheese they use was not regular mozzarella, but tasted like asiago. It was way too strong for my kids liking. But it was only $10 so can’t complain. The appetizers were great. The hot chicken sandwich was OK but very messy same with the fish taco very ￼ watery, and messy Read more We booked a table for 4 a month in advance.  We showed up on time., and were seated right away.  The table was basically "" In the kitchen"".  But ok.   Good food and the service was very good.  This is our second time dining here.   Definitely noisier and busier then our week day visit  Food was great. Server was not. Very inattentive. Didn't have any cutlery and when he served us our mac & cheese we asked for cutlery.

We ate inside but many others enjoyed the patio. The service was excellent.  Zuzu is a new, spacious restaurant with a nicely decorated interior. The food however, was dissapointing. The portions are small, my Cesar salad with brussel sprouts had everything in it except the greens, the fried sea bream was too greasy, and the choice of desserts is limited. The apperitivos were probably the best that night but we came for dinner, not just drinks!  Mediocre brunch spot with prices that don't match the quality.

Would I have liked more Chardonnay options? Yes. But overall I had a lovely experience.  Small menu which is great as you know all food is fresh. Great food and service, perfect vibe.  Disorganized. Service mediocre. Food was good. Pricey.  Reign had good food but the service was a bit stuffy. There was no sommelier to help with their extensive wine list. The waiter made a poor recommendation, so I wound up finding a Hermitage that was quite excellent. The restaurant attendant was quite a bit friendlier than the waiter, who needs to be reminded that he was there to serve us, not the other way around.  While visiting from the UK it was out first time at Reign. Overall the experience was good. Small details brought our rating down however. Considering the price of the dish there was not enough lobster in the lobster linguine.

I chose to go to this restaurant as they advertised that they served Osso Bucco with Risotto. Much to my surprise, it wasn't a veal shank as described online as well as in their menu. It was a plate of risotto (with too much salt) and some diced meat with pieces of cartilage in it that was deplorable. Osso Bucco is always a shank of veal that is cooked so soft that you do need a knife to separate it from the veal bone. (no bone in their rendition) I am not sure that meat was even veal.

Every team member was so incredibly lovely and even noted a birthday at our table and brought out dessert! We had a great time and will be back!  Terrific service and incredible ambiance. Lighting was just a titch too dark as even the servers couldn’t read the menus easily. Because of all the gorgeous dark wood paneling and apothecary jars there isn’t a whole lot of sound dampening textiles in the space to muffle the increase of noise as the evening goes on, it was never “loud” just a steady moderate din that made intimate conversation somewhat difficult.

I do wish there were a few sturdy vegan shareable options, as the vegetarian ones were heavy on butter and cheese, delicious but not ideal if you can’t tolerate lactose and prefer not to eat meat.

The only thing I didn’t like was that it was announced by the hostess to us before we were to be seated that they had a two hour seating time limit. We thought that was strange as seating limits were only introduced for COVID purposes, which is not an issue anymore. Secondly we came all the way from Mississauga to dine there, so we thought that was a bit unusual and unprofessional, and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth as a first impression of the place.

The pancakes with blueberry sauce, cinnamon butter and side of bacon were delicious. The decaf coffee was awful but the regular coffee was good. The waiter and ambience were terrific.  Awesome pancakes and iced coffee . My friend let me try her potatoes- which were great. She got the lobster Benedict and enjoyed it .  Ordered the salmon Benny. The English muffins were small, stale, and overly toasted. The eggs were virtually boiled…not poached. For 20.00, not worth it.

Can’t recommend enough  The dishes were multi-layered in texture and taste.....esp. pea salad and pork neck...
Service was great.  Awesome spot for two to share plates and have a not private conversation.
I'll be going back for sure.  The food here is some of the most interesting I’ve tried in the city. Every item we chose was consistently delicious. Fresh ingredients with perfect flavour pairings. The sauce on the marinated mussels was to die for. The warm corn tart would have me coming back again and again! Strongly recommend this hidden gem.  This was my first time at this restaurant despite living in the neighbourhood. I've been curious to check it out, but I'm a pescatarian, and the options seemed limited, which has previously deterred me from going. Last night, I decided to go with a friend, and we ordered the following items. I will 100% return. Overall, it was great!

The place is so cute, inside and out. There are lots of adorable details, down to the tchotchkes in the bathroom. 

Food:
Pea salad 4.5/5 - This was fresh, well-balanced and spicy. 
Sweet Corn tart 5/5 - This was my favourite dish. It was comforting yet not too heavy and fresh due to the greens on top. I highly recommend this. 
Goat's Curd 4.5/5 - This was amazing. The veg, cheese and baguette went very well together. It was delicate yet flavourful. The bread was very toasted so it was slightly hard to eat. Had it not been as toasted, I would give this 5/5.
Shell on shrimp 3/5—This dish was just okay. I found it hard to eat and struggled. I could not get the meat out because it stuck to the shell. I also found the hot tomato with horseradish to be a bit of a weird combo. I ended up taking it home and eating it for leftovers, but I only managed to get a small piece of meat from each shrimp. It's not a great dish to eat in public without a bib. I would personally not eat this again. 
Pork dish - I can't comment as I did not try it, but it looked terrific, and my friend loved it. 

Note: This was too much food for two people. My friend said he was hungry, but I think the server could have warned us about the portions of the shrimp and pork dishes as this was a lot of food.

Cocktails:
Martini 2.5/5—The martini was very watery and flavourless. I don't typically drink vodka martins, but I thought I would give it a try. The drink was mostly water. Perhaps it was overshaken, but it also wasn't that cold. 
Paloma 3/5 - this was ok but over-sweetened. 
I would personally stick to wine here and skip cocktails next time.

SATURDAY: ALA CARTE MENU AVAILABLE
SUNDAY BRUNCH BUFFET","Read more Thanksgiving dinner special: Turkey very dry but great vegetables and mashed potatoes; chocolate cake dessert very hard and stale  Excellent food and atmosphere. Already planning our next visit.  Another great Thanksgiving Dinner.
The menu provided something for everyone.  We went for Thanksgiving dinner that was advertised as $30. Well, that's without appetizer or dessert. The whole meal is $48. It was hot and a huge portion, but not tasty! The turkey was some kind of processed turkey roll. The stuffing was soggy and tasteless. The cranberry sauce was Sour. The mashed potato was under a pile of all the other stuff and smeared on the plate but smeared differently on each person's plate - no consistency TD it was supposed to be decoration. We really felt like we were in a cheap dinner for Thanksgiving. Very disappointing. Read more Breakfast buffet is always good just wish there were some more options  We were looking for a restaurant close to Mirvish Theater and found this place with a very good reviews.
What a disappointment! The food is horrible.
They advertise that their pasta is made fresh there but it tasted like very stored bought and lacking the flavors.
Their Moroccan chicken with grilled vegetables was a joke! No flavor at all and 4 pieces of very thin slices of vegetables.
The place is nice. Feels like a pub more, where you can get some food not to be hungry but don’t expect culinary experience.
I don’t understand how it gets so high reviews.
I spoke with our server about the food lacking the flavors and he actually agreed with me and said that lots of customers don’t like the flavors so they play safe.
The point is he agreed. 
What a disappointment. I will never come back. Read more Had a very nice Sunday brunch on the patio of Hot House.  May be one of the last days warm enough to do that.  It was very nice.  Food was good, waiter was attentive without being intrusive.  Of course there is some street noise (the patio is right beside Front Street), but not bad.  Food was really good; had the chicken curry and it was great. Scotty was excellent.  great food, spacious, nice soft jazz music on sunday brunch.  My family and I haven’t been there since pre pandemic times, for their Sunday brunch buffet.

Food: To be honest, the food experience was a little disappointing… we understand the idea of shrinking the buffet menu is a method to improve its quality. Unfortunately I didn’t really see the improvement… the roast beef was on the dryer side and by the time I walked my dish back to my table, the meat was already cold. I wanted a small piece of salmon Wellington but the server was too busy making an omelet for someone else so I didn’t bother waiting. The salad bar was quite sad… they tried making a nice seafood salad but it was just a few pieces of shrimp and calamari over a large bed of mixed greens, which did not seem appealing to us. There were only a handful of cheese and cold cuts selection as well at the charcuterie section. Also, no muffins or danishes to choose from… very limited croissants and breakfast baked goods. The only thing that stood out to me was their delicious hot bread pudding. Otherwise, the mussels were alright and that was it.

Service: We were greeted nicely once we arrived. The server kinda disappeared on us for a good chunk of time but, it didn’t bother us too much… our plates were still cleared in a timely manner but our coffees were running empty towards the end. She was quite friendly too.

Atmosphere: The restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere, still had their Sunday brunch live jazz which was great. Customers were all pretty chill, there was a pleasant large party that were seated close by to our table. Lovely environment. To add to it, the restaurant had a face lift and it’s slightly more modern than pre pandemic days, overall pretty clean.

Overall, I’m not sure if we would be back anytime soon again. For the price tag, I expected a little more than what I experienced there on Sunday. I can see this being a great place to meet up and catch up with family and friends but don’t expect the food to be superb. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/46681745.webp

Each meal was brought out perfectly spaced out and I was never left wondering why the waitor/waitress was talking too long or the food was taking to long to come out. Would 10/10 recommend to anyone.  We were craving the burgers. They disappointed us both. Either something has changed, which is weird.. it’s the Keg or it was just one of those days. We have had the burgers in the past and love them.  Excellent service.  We were checked on regularly to make sure everything was good.  Food was delicious!  Excellent service and experience. Baked Brie Duck confit feature was delicious. Steaks done to perfection.  As always, the service is phenomenal. Our server was very kind and efficient. We have a good time even if things don't go perfectly. Our pepper shaker did not work and we asked for it to be replaced. The reply was positive but we ended up not getting it so just swapped with another table. One of our dinner order was steak and lobster and the lobster did not come out with the steak. They apologized and brought out the lobster 5 mins later. Another order was peppercorn steak which usually comes with a sauce on side. They apologized and said right away but then just came out with gravy instead.
 Did not want to make a fuss so just went with it.
Again, overall it did not affect our wonderful evening. I have noticed though there there are about 3 or 4 hiccups consistently the last few times I have gone, per visit. It does not deter us from going however. I provide this information as it was asked of me so I am just giving honest feedback. Read more Being from the US, this was our first time to dine at The Keg. It was one of the best restaurants we have eaten at in all our travels. Our server was very accommodating and attentive. Our meals were amazing. There were no complaints. Highly recommend checking it out.  You won't be disappointed.  Horrible no service waitress forgot about us we had to leave  Great meal from start to finish. 
Loved the happy hour prices and options. 
Our server was great !  Service was great considering it was a pre-game rush. What wasn’t great was ordering a steak and lobster tail and getting what was closer to a jumbo shrimp than a lobster tail.
Definitely not a good value.  Keg always delivers, great food and service, wonderful pre game experience!!",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/51431053.webp

Most of the dishes were unforgettable, although we did enjoy the first course of croissants and the dessert course. Would likely not visit again.

There’s a lovely less upscale bar upstairs thati want to check out next time. Thank you!  Absolutely incredible food, beautifully presented and the most incredible flavours.

Will definitely be back to try more of the food and drinks!  I came to Alice this past Saturday to celebrate my birthday and I have to say I was extremely disappointed.

I had a reservation for 4 at 8:15 and arrived around 8:20 (well within the 15 minute grace period) and they did not have a table ready for us. There was actually an empty table for 4 right by the entrance but I guess it was reserved for someone more important? Who knows. Although I had reserved a table in the dining room, we were brought to the patio instead. I didn't say anything because the weather was nice but the fact that they moved me to the patio without even an apology or acknowledgement was confusing. It was also too dark to read the menu without a flashlight as there is no lighting above where we were seated.

I wish I could review the food but unfortunately I didn't get to try it. The wait was ridiculously long; eventually around 10:00 we asked the waitress to just bring the bill so we could leave and get food elsewhere because it was not coming out any time soon and we had to be somewhere else by 11. They offered to (and did) bring us a round of birthday shots and a slice of cheesecake for our trouble, but after reading other reviews I believe it is their standard practice to offer free shots/desserts for birthdays. I didn't expect any type of compensation, but don't pretend you're compensating when you're not, that's just shady.

Our server also told to come on a Wednesday next time because it's less busy. I guess it's my fault for thinking having a reservation meant I would have a reserved table and be served food. It also didn't seem all that busy, by the time we left there were several empty tables on the patio. I assume they just forgot to make our food, considering no one came by to apologize or even acknowledge the wait until we brought it up.

If I could, I would give Alice 1.5 stars because the drinks were good and the decor is cute. I was very excited to try the food but unfortunately now I never will. Read more We waited 30 mins after placing our food order only to be then told they didn’t have the item we ordered.

I understand the chef hand-picks the lobster, but it’s still unpleasant to encounter shells in the meal. That said, I really enjoyed dining here.

Best best  A quiet and cozy Japanese restaurant. I personally loved the ambience—super intimate, dimly lit—perfect for a nice dinner date. We got the signature tasting menu which consisted of oysters, caviar, uni, toro and more for $88/pp. The 8 courses was just the right amount of food as we left feeling full and satiated. Highlights of the courses for me were the uni toast, oyster, and pesto udon. All the ingredients used were so fresh and worked beautifully with one another. You can really tell that the menu was well thought out and intricately curated. The wagyu (main course) was slightly underwhelming, a little on the dryer side and no depth to the steak flavour. However, this also may be because every course prior to the steak was amazing and left us wanting more. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/25694438.webp

However other tables are fine and comfortable as well. Service with genuine smiles.  The menu is standard and safe. The service and views are exemplary. A great option to have a power lunch and enjoy great company.  Great spot with a view to have productive meetings etc.. Everything was very good, except our mains -everybody ordered the duck which was incredibly dry and overcooked. Quite disappointing at this price point.  A luxurious interior with beautiful views of the Toronto skyline. An incredible wine collection, and in my opinion, the best sweet potato fries in city.  We thoroughly enjoyed everything about our experience. The staff were superb - friendly, helpful, and attentive. The food was served piping hot and was delicious. The four of us each had different meals - salmon, butter chicken, braised ribs, and lamb, and we all loved our choices. The view is spectacular. Thanks for a great experience!  The service was outstanding! The food was perfect. The views were amazing. Highly recommend  Food was very good as well as the service.  I found it odd that they would charge $5.00 for a basket of bread where most other restaurants would not.  We go to Stratus for the view. And I think the managers forgot the food. My Duck was overcooked. Not a little but too much. It was hard to cut to eat and to digest. I wish same attention was brought to the food as to the view.

We were initially going to get 4 Mains (For a group of 4) until we noticed the duck. So when asked what would be better our kind server informed us that certain mains are actually meant to be shared and will come out with tongs. Definitely not the case both the skirt steak and the udon can be eaten alone and was a bit of a nightmare to portion as none of us wanted to take more then others. Nonetheless, we ended up getting the duck and the 2 other mains mentioned which had us a bit hungry at the end but satisfied. Their creamy lobster udon was delicious no complaints a solid 7-8/10, the skirt steak was a bit more on the rare side but still probably the best dish of the night being a 8-8.5/10, and lastly the duck. The duck did come with fried rice, pancakes, and their sides/sauce but for 120 dollars I expected a bit more. And the Duck itself had a bit of a strange iron taste. Maybe since I’m used to a more traditional Peking duck but I’m not too sure. I’d have to unfortunately say the duck was the biggest letdown of the night being only around a 6.5/10, the fried rice was a bit too bland and oily, and their sauce a bit too fragrant very easily overpowering the flavours of the duck even though I intentionally used less sauce. Overall we had an amazing night I believe our total bill was 300 for everything so it was not bad but I would hope they improve their Peking duck in the future as for $120 I expect more. To finish off the experience I can’t forget the service which was 10/10 fantastic. Our server kept our waters full and was super kind. Read more Food was not very good.  Couldn’t even finish the wagyu and one of the sushi rolls.  Drinks and service were good though.  Had my birthday here and the DASHA team helped me organize it amazingly! Mackenzie and Susan their reservation coordinators made sure everything was set up for the day even noting the specific allergies and dietary requirements of my party (vegan, pineapple allergy, celiac, no beef, etc.). My friends felt very accommodated and cared for by the team. From the second we walked in till the second we left. Food was delicious definitely would come back for the Duck fried rice and brussel sprouts, all my friends enjoyed their food! The team brought out signs and sparklers throughout the night so I (upon my request) I felt very celebrated and had so much fun!

The black dumplings didn’t take the same tastes almost cold and the sauce just not good like the first time. The general chicken supper salty.

The food quality was off - we were both “unwell” all evening and I think it was the shrimp dumplings - they tasted fishy. The server finally checked on us at the end of wanting anything else and we gave food quality feedback; the server offered a dessert - we declined, then offered shots - we declined. She took two happy hour drinks off our bill which was kind but didn’t resolve the issue of the food. I’d be hard pressed to recommend or return.

Amazing food. I did order Ossobuco.
It was too noisy and too dark. We barely could read the menu. The service was not that great. We ordered a meal that never came. I would come back basically because of the great food.  Table was a bit cramped.
There was another party which was very loud so it was a bit uncomfortable since it was hard to speak over their loud voices, being right next to them .  7 Numbers is a great ‘go-to’ restaurant for good food at a great value. There is a nice variety of sides to accompany meals. This evening, I had the shrimp risotto with asparagus. The shrimp were nicely prepared. My friend had the linguine pescatore - a medley of shellfish with a light tomato sauce that she enjoyed. Portions are generous. We shared the caprese salad.

Service is attentive and the location on Danforth is convenient. Read more We ordered calamari and Brussels sprouts which were pretty good. The calamari needed more flavour or lemon, or perhaps an aioli. It was too pain. The eggplant was a bit paper like and bland.

The margarita flight was outstanding because of the flavors and presentation. 

The fish tacos were okay. The tortillas are not freshly made and the slaw needed more acid.

The churros were light and crispy. The caramel sauce they were served with was perfect but the chocolate goo served as well was not pleasant.

The corn dish was woefully underseasoned and overpriced for the portion.

The cauliflower was a hodgepodge of a dish that lacked cohesiveness.

The biggest disappointment was the salsa. It was like eating spaghetti sauce. It was boring, one texture, and unimpressive. Even with the 'hot sauces' presented on the side added, it lacked flavor.

Super friendly service and great atmosphere.   Be sure to try the fired calamari.  I’m not sure if they were short staffed or this is the way it always is at this restaurant, but, the service was very poor last night.  My wife and I had a 7:15 reservation. From the moment we sat down we had a difficult time getting someone to take our order. Our server finally took our order and said he would bring bread out “right away.” Our appetizer arrived about 15 minutes later and the server who delivered it saw that we needed bread to go with it. He said he would be “right back” with it. The bread never came. Finally, the server who delivered the dish saw that we still didn’t have bread and gave us a small basket. He acknowledged that it was too late as we had already finished our appetizer. Then, the main courses arrived. I had ordered their lasagna. The server who dropped it off at our table said she would be right back with some Parmesan cheese. Guess what? That never came either. We asked our original server for the cheese, he said he would get some. Didn’t. Finally I had to stand up and literally stand in the path of the servers to demand some cheese before my meal got any colder. I then got some cheese. My lasagna was pretty good, however, my wife’s veal with lemon sauce was not. There was no lemon taste at all. We paid, after we had to flag down our server to get the bill. We left an appropriately small tip for the poor service we received.

Overall, we felt very ignored most of the time, except when the food was being delivered, when we felt like the service was very rushed. The noise level was very high, which was fine considering how small the restaurant is. It is really too bad as 7 Numbers is very convenient to where we live. We won’t be rushing back any time soon.

Very dark inside. Could lighten it up. Also cod dish was overly spicy. 4 of us ordered it and only one person could eat it. Supposedly much more spicy than before.

My girlfriend and I came here and it was just bad from the second we came in. We were not greeted by anyone (seemed like there was only a bartender working?) for about the first 5-10 mins we were standing there. When we finally did the bartender pointed at the table from over the bar that we had reserved, which was not polite nor good service in my opinion.

We never expect super speedy service, because we understand how challenging service industry jobs can be, however, there was a total of maybe 5-8 people in the entire restaurant including me and my girlfriend. 

Basically, if you want good, friendly or timely service. Do not come here. We ended up leaving because of how off the vibes were in the first 15 mins of us being there.

I’ll go back again and recommend it to friends Read more It was not our typical visit to Cluny’s. It’s generally very busy with a lively vibe. For a Friday evening, it was practically empty. We arrived at 6:00 pm for a pint in the bar before our dining room reservation at 7:00. The dining room had 6 tables occupied at 7:00, when we left at 8:30. There were less than 10 tables occupied. If you are looking for craft beer, Cluny’s is now a Molson  account! We
Ordered the steak frites w 7 oz tender loin. They were ok but not super, both were over cooked. The service in both the bar & dining room was still excellent. I think you need to rethink craft beer & bit more attention to how you grill your steaks. Read more We had a bit of a mixed experience for dinner last evening. On a positive note, the ambiance was nice and we had a pleasant waiter. The food was overall quite delicious, although my pork chop was a bit overcooked.

On the negative side, we had a rather negative experience with the wine list and then the sommelier. We had ordered a bottle of French Rose which indicated it was from Provence. When the bottle arrived, it was indeed a rose from the same winemaker, but from Languedoc instead. We asked to speak with the sommelier and asked him about the difference in the wines. He proceeded to tell us that it was all from the same region - it is not. 

When we mentioned that we actually live in Languedoc part of the year and that it was not the same as Provence, he became abrupt and unpleasant. We were celebrating a special occasion and I did not want to spoil the evening by arguing further, so we went ahead with the wine. After doing research the next day, I found that the Languedoc bottle was not of the same quality and was quite a bit less expensive, even though we were charged the price of the Provence bottle.

If he had handled the situation better, it likely wouldn't have resulted in this lengthy review. Will we return? Maybe. Read more Good service and ambience, but in my opinion, over priced.  $41 for an average burger and fries!.  Ceviché was amazing. So was the Monk Fish. Oysters were very good. Only recommendation would be to warn patrons about the hot/spicy sauce that was way to intense for a moderate palate. My date was coughing for about 10 minutes.
But overall, it was a fabulous meal and Na's service was great.  Very nice ambience with French period music indoors and a relaxing ivy trellis enclosed patio. Lunch was beyond expectations, with delicious PEI oysters for only USD$36 per dozen, wonderful cucumber and summer melon gazpacho with fresh crab and cilantro, and excellent mussels in a Dijon mustard wine sauce.  This is a quality restaurant. Very nice ambience either outside on the patio or inside. The menu is exquisite, flavoursome dishes and incredible desserts. Coupled with this is top notch service, friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend!  Our steak was cooked perfectly!  Lovely ambiance.  Beautiful restaurant and ambiance
The server was very attentive, so charming!  Love the mimosa options. Beautiful space with lots of options for food - feels like the type of menu that you can’t go wrong no matter what you pick.

we went to edna for a more elegant dining feel - we were celebrating my birthday early.

we also had the veal chop parm- delicious! Read more Nice looking restaurant with tasty food.  They encourage family style, sharing plate dining.

It was awesome.
I will be back  Disappointing food and not worth it at all. We chose this place based on the reviews we read online, which I’m totally lost on how this place has 4.6 stars. The pastas were watery and bland, and the portions were very small. We ordered the cacio e Pepe which seemed like it was made with instant noodles and confused on how something so simple can be messed up. The tagliatelle funghi was even more watery and seemed like it was put together with scraps. We also ordered the calamari for starters which was super salty. Our server was very friendly and accommodating however, but definitely won’t be returning here. Far better Italian options in the city. Read more Our server was outstanding! Great food, good value.  My third visit to the restaurant. I brought 3 friends along to celebrate a birthday. Great sitting on the patio.

The cocktails are very inventive, the menu is well curated and there is something for everyone from a vegetarian to a carb-lover and everything in between.

I find the portions generous (from cocktails to pizzas to desserts) and the service is perfect.

Fortunately all the 3 friends enjoyed their dinner and the restaurant and we all agreed we'd be back soon.

I had the braised lamb but there was almost no lamb. It was also very very garlicky. Service was quick and attentive. $29 for a pasta main and 23.5 for an 8 ounce barbera.  Great restaurant in the financial core. Lots of space in the bar, on the patio, inside dining. I have never been upstairs but I could hear the music.

The portions are generous and the bar atmosphere is fun.

1) the server didn’t ask how’s our food at all, instead he asked the two tables around us.
2) the server served the second bottle sparking water without asking first .
3) right before I pay for the bill, the server joked about he’s surprised the two of us are able to finish the porterbouse  (?)   um… I didn’t get any recommendations on what to order but the server clearly has doubt on what we ordered?

My only comment would be that the food wasn’t quiteeee hot enough but it was still delish  We had an absolutely wonderful experience.

Our server was particularly sweet and when she heard me coughing brought hot water with lemon of her own volition and kept it topped up all night.

We ordered all the notable menu specials and all were delicious.  Special kudos to the fried chicken skin in the Ceasar salad. What nice change from the bacon options often served.  The pastrami was really yummy! The chocolate bubka was good but if you like a really yeast doughy version of this dessert I suggest you try something different (this bubka is more crispy croissant-ish) .

Thank you again for a successful evening  My favourite place to socialize with great wine choices and a fabulous menu! Service always superb!  It was very nice. We sat by the window so a bit chilly but we were probably not used to the cold weather that just hit us.

It was a business meeting so very nice to be seated in this more secluded area.  My experience was a very excellent one. I would recommend to every one  Crispy chicken wean used to be more portion than this time.  We eat here frequently and usually have a great experience but today everything seemed a miss. We Each ordered the 12oz striploin. One cut was fine, the other full of fat and almost impossible to cut through. It was one of those meals where my wife tried to just finish without taking time to send it back but it was not edible. Instead we ordered some extra drinks and shared most of my steak. We pointed out the poor quality steak when the plates were cleared but our server just shrugged it off like no big deal. It was an easy decision to skip dessert at this point. We paid the bill (everything was full price) and left with a small tip for getting half of the food right. Looking back, you should always demand a redo or charge removal for  substandard food, especially when your all in bill is $250 for 2 steaks and 4 drinks.

We will take a break from Earls restaurants for a while, maybe return someday and see if their service and food has improved…. Read more Always a fun place to eat, with perfect portions and friendly staff. We will be back!  Cold steak, you need really hot plates to serve ribeyes.  We had a great time.

Overall, great place for a date or to swing by with family/friends! :) Read more I can’t really speak to the food because the service was so slow I had to leave before the food came (almost two hours after our arrival at the restaurant). The other three people in our party stayed and ate their dinner.  I should also add that the menu was completely different from the one posted online, and the new menu does not appeal to me. Overall - severely understaffed and disappointing new menu. Read more Great food and service. Got a bit noisy once they got busy, but they can’t control that.  My friends and I recently tried the new menu at Positano, and it really exceeded our expectations! As regulars, we were excited to check out the unique southern Italian dishes, and they did not disappoint. I had the Cuppetiello di Mare, Colori D’Autunno, and La Carne, while my friend enjoyed the Scialatielli ai Frutti di Mare and Paccheri al Ragù Napoletano. For dessert, we went with É la Pizza Margherita? and Babà-Misù. Every single dish was so delicious, and the atmosphere was the perfect mix of romantic and cosy. The service was excellent too, a great match for the chef’s amazing work. This has been my go-to spot in the neighbourhood for a while now, and I’ll definitely be back to try more from the new menu! Read more There has been an overhaul of the menu, and while I appreciate the efforts gone into making it a ""true"" Italian experience, the menu is disjointed, only 3 pasta dishes that are all new, nothing from the previous owner / menu.  30 years in business and nothing to save?  Also the pricing has gone up a lot.  A $49 veal chop with extra $13 for dried up side of vegetables - that is not ok.  I noticed the people who ordered the spaghetti were very pleased, but the Ragu Napolitana was not great. Read more Positano Restaurant on Mount Pleasant Road is such a cozy hidden gem! I’ve been there many times, and every visit has been amazing. The service is something I’ve never seen before—really top-notch. They do fine dining, which is hard to find in this area compared to other restaurants. Their food is amazing and rich in flavour; I’ve never been disappointed. My favourites are definitely the veal chop and branzino. For cocktails, my favourite is the Negroni—they make the best one!

I love seeing the owner every single time. She’s a woman who runs this small business and is incredibly knowledgeable. She always greets us with a smile, and that personal touch is really important. As a woman, it’s so important for me to support businesses like hers. That kind of service, along with the quality of the food, is hard to find in Toronto. There are other restaurants in the area that offer similar dishes, but this restaurant really pays attention to quality, and you can tell. I highly recommend Positano to anyone looking for an amazing dining experience! Read more Great pizza and fantastic service. What else can I ask for?  Nice northern Italian restaurant and nice menu.     Also pleasant ambiance.    Service was a bit spotty and slow - our waitress was nice,  but she disappeared after we got menus - and we didn’t get our wine until after our appetizers arrived.   Portions good but a bit underwhelming - had the seafood special, which was tasty but light on the seafood.  My wife had pizza which was really tasty.

Read more My partner and I had an anniversary dinner here October 10th, the food was good but the restaurant has a tv with old Italian movies playing on a loop for ambiance, the tv is large and central to the Bellona Cantina seating area and hard to look away from or avoid seeing when not looking at your food. At one point during the evening the movie depicted a woman being overtly sexually assaulted for multiple minutes. This made us feel highly uncomfortable and ruined the ambiance for us, it made the experience very viscerally disgusting and hurtful.

I highly recommend this experience for everyone and will be posting a great review to my followers on Tiktok. We live in the area so we will be back!  LOVED THE EXPERIENCE!

I don’t think a vegan/vegetarian restaurant should charge extra for plant milk  Lovely atmosphere, very friendly and attentive staff, and DELICIOUS food. Best bruschetta I've ever had.  The best vegetarian food I have tasted in Toronto.  The variety and choices available in the $27.00 lunch 3 course menu is astounding.  Great food and service. Highly Recommend.

The food and drinks were absolutely delicious.  Came here for our one year wedding anniversary and it’s safe to say that we will never be back. Terrible experience. Our server Jennifer was actually very kind, but the other guy was just constantly trying to upsell and it was way too obvious. The food is definitely not authentic and we went home upset with our experience. The lamb shank was flavourless in my opinion.

Good first time experience. Loved the poppers  I’ve eaten at the original Queen west location many times and the food  /ambience has been great.
Last night I ordered a bourbon  only to be told my first selection was sold out the second choice was locked in a cabinet that one server told us that the person with the key wasn’t working another server claimed the lock was the problem. Given that they tout their bourbon selection as a selling point it was rather odd. Also perhaps have a bourbon list printed instead of a sheaf of papers meant for the bar staff.
Food was plentiful and my friend’s chicken was fine but the beef brisket was dry and gray.

We aimed to try a bit of Japanese/french fusion dishes and everything we tried turned out delicious. Chris our server and the manager were friendly which partially made up the unpleasant seating experience I had to go through.

I understand it’s a tiny space and hard to manage around the reservations, but having to witness the server convince two seated customers to move to take the “better” seats in the back, then point at the less ideal table they were just sitting at and told me it was mine is a different story. When I was simply asking if there’s any other table in the back for me as well, the response I got was simply “no and do you have any problem with that?” This kind of response really caught me off guard, and made me feel like I’ve asked something I shouldn’t have. If not for a birthday dinner, I’d not have stayed at all. Maybe he’s just having a bad day but I don’t see how I deserve treatment like this.

$14-$15 for a glass of wine/prosecco a bit excessive  Great welcome, excellent service, first class food.!  Food is always good
Service was terrible and they were unapologetic for their mistakes  Great food, service was terrible this time however. We sat there for 30mins before server even offered water. Only reason he came by was because I looked at him. Great food but disappointing service this time around.  Fantastic food. Everything we tried (3 pastas, 1 app, 1 salad, 1 pizza) was cooked to absolute perfection. Pastas are hearty and decadent. Very rich and quality ingredients! The service was lacking a tad - we were seated at a far window and we felt forgotten about right away and had trouble getting staff attention even on a Wednesday night but the food made up for it haha.

thank you for service  I can’t complaint about the ambiance and the environment which is right by the waterfront. The server was friendly and was good but I suppose you don’t go there for the food. Very disappointed in the quality of the food. My son couldn’t finish his chicken fingers which were not good as I tasted it. My chicken sandwich was good but the salad was not a garden salad. There were raisins and flax seed mixed with feta cheese and greens. Weird combination. My wife ordered fish and chips and the fish was missing something which was not the best she had. Maybe we had high expectations but had to share our experience. Read more Great outdoor eating area, can watch the planes/lake/sunset. Great service.  Over the summer the Goodman Pub and Kitchen has been hit or miss. The main reason it was a miss in the past is because they could not accommodate us with dining area that we had requested and was confirmed at time of reservation. We went elsewhere. 
This time it was a hit. Yes it was a Sunday night and yes it was not busy. However the service was outstanding and the food was delivered hot and tasty. We credit our server (Mo) for the great service and hot food. Read more Nice restaurant on the harbour front. Outside area had screens and heaters which was nice as it was a chilly evening when we visited.
The food was nice and good value.  Food was too salty and service was poor even though there weren't many other patrons in the restaurant. We were told that there would be an automatic service charge applied due to the size of our group (12) which would've been fine if there was actual service going on. We were seated in the inner dining room so I can't comment on the service in the outdoor area. Overall not a good experience. Read more The place has a great atmosphere and is very well located. The patio offers a lovely view of the lake. The food is decent, and the service is friendly, though a bit slow. However, we had a rather unpleasant experience. We were a group of nine, and as we were wrapping up, it got chilly on the patio. The three of us who were still there asked to move to another table. We went to the one the waiter suggested, but shortly after, the manager approached us, saying that the table belonged to another section with a different server. She asked us to return to our previous area if we weren’t planning to order more. She didn’t bother helping us find another table or get us settled; we had to do it ourselves. I understand servers rely on tips, but this kind of treatment isn’t acceptable. It felt like once you’ve spent your money, you no longer matter. I hope they improve their service. Read more The quality of the fish and chips was unacceptable. The fish was not cooked to the desired doneness, and the fries were not fresh.

The waitress arrived approximately 20 minutes after placing our order. During this time, we engaged in a conversation about our drinks and food choices. However, the drinks arrived after the food had been served, and we were forced to consume half of our meal before receiving our beverages.

Despite our request for drinks without ice, the instructions were not followed. Additionally, no cutlery was provided until we specifically asked for it, along with ketchup.

Given these issues, we would not recommend this establishment to others. Read more Waiting for outdoor patio was a waste of time. Lots of open tables but insufficient staffing to seat and serve them.

-Food was well-presented, unique, and delicious. It was our first time eating here and the manager offered complementary samples of the Sato Maki.
-For the best bang for your buck, I would recommend the Dressed Nigiri, Pollo den Miso, Brussels Sprouts, and Arroz Chaufa. Another honorable mention would be the Nikkei Gyoza.
-The restaurant also noted that it was me and my wife's anniversary, so our desserts were served with sparklers.
-Our main server, Samim, was very attentive, professional, friendly, and performed his duties with care.

Areas of Improvement
-We had another server throughout the night who seemed a bit ""neutral"" in her demeanor. She wasn't unprofessional or rude, but seemed as if she wanted to get things over with and just sort of placed everything in the middle of the table (food and utensils) whenever she served us. She provided clean utensils throughout the meal, but I guess forgot to collect the dirty ones, so at a certain point each of us had about 3 forks, 2 spoons, and a few extra napkin cloths.
- Music was a bit loud

Not a dealbreaker though, I would definitely return. Read more Most amazing staff, had a wonderful night with my family. Food and atmosphere were 10/10.

We would definitely go to this restaurant again. The washrooms were an interesting experience with the neon murals and everything being black! Read more Food is presented nicely. Primarily tapas style. I’ve been here many times, and sadly service is not at the level one would expect for a high end restaurant. We had to request serving utensils a few times so we could share our dishes, had yo call the staff a few times for beverage top up. It’s common they have private events at the bar area.  Great food, but the price is agressive for lunch!  Tried the Chotto Hour and everything was absolutely on time! Would definitely go again!  Joseph was very attentive!

We (2 guests) ordered more than eleven plates between a-la-carte and the tasting menu and the pacing of the dishes was frustratingly slow. We were swatting at flies over the course of the entire dinner. Including edamame as a course of its own was an interesting decision. The exclusion of proteins in certain dishes and the complete lack of red meat cheapened the experience. The decision to serve frozen ice cream style mochi (usually found in convenience stores and grocery stores because it is easy to import) was also a major misstep; you could look at it as a westernized dessert but in Canada the handmade room temperature mochi is more special.

Our server was very sweet but we had been sitting there for a while before being greeted so when she came we were ready to order everything.

Many Tapas are  served on crostinis - fills one up but it’s the crostinis, not the substance that is filling you up - disappointing. Our server, Crystal, was very attentive. There was a long pause in between our served tapas. She recognized this & voluntarily compted us with a round of drinks but when the final bill came, they were included. I drew this to her attention & she willingly reversed the charges. Overall, would rate this one 3.5/5 - it’s very expensive and the tapas are good but not fabulous.

Our server was very aware and conscious of our kids allergies which is always appreciated.  Great food, great service, great drinks, great vibe. Great!  Lovely restaurant.  Great atmosphere and cozy seating area arrangements that allow easy conversation. Our waiter, Mark, was very attentive and personable. Food was outstanding, as usual.  All good. First time that Lobster was not great but I did not complain as Keg is a favourite place to go  Excellent and friendly service. Great table and ambience.  Food was very well prepared and good.  Very filling.  The only downside was the music was a bit loud and bit too aggressive for the setting.  Something more jazz like and softer would have worked better.  The overall service was good! Last visit, the server was EXCELLENT! This server was ‘ok’- very pleasant,-,not as seasoned as the last server., 
She gave good wine advice!
The calamari starter was great!’ 
The steak was on par, but the ceasar salad was not so good… it tasted like it came out of a bag, with few Caesar  ingredients and the dressing was not incorporated …
For the price of this meal, I would expect higher standards,,

Amy was so friendly and attentive and made sure everything came out quickly so we could make it to the concert. There’s a reason it’s our go to spot anytime we are in Toronto. Thank you for a great evening!  The hosts were amazing, as our go train was majorly delayed and we ended up being over 30 minutes late for our reservation, but they still kept our table ready for us and I really appreciate that.  Especially since we were a table of 8 with kids.
The food was really good.  Portions were on the smaller side, but good value given the prices.  And we weren’t interested in taking home leftovers, so it was perfect.

Was hoping the first bad experience was a one off but unfortunately it was worse this second visit.  Had the Mexican Bowl.  It was very bland and something someone can easily make at home with the left over food in their fridge.  Was shocked by the tiny portion size.  Great service reasonably priced noise levels were moderate good seating  Good place to go. We had a reservation but didn't need one. Not as crazy busy as other places right at steps of go train and only a quick walk. Will go again. Great staff and great little patio.  Great food and service.

The service was outstanding.  We celebrated my aunt's 100th Birthday Afternoon Tea at Epoch Bar & Kitchen.  We were a party of 11 guests.  The staff were wonderful and very accommodating.  The Afternoon Tea there was excellent.  The finger sandwiches were delicious.  The scones were warm and were so tasty with the clotted cream and strawberry jam.

A special shout-out to Lindsay who made sure we were all well taken care of. Read more Celebrated my birthday with a large group of friends at Epoch on a Thursday evening. Loved the beautiful interior and warm atmosphere of the restaurant. The restaurant was lively but not overly crowded and the location was very convenient for those commuting or driving so that was an added plus. When it came to the dining experience, we enjoyed select cocktails and made sure to order shareables for the table. Highlights were the NY striploin and the oysters, along with the mushroom truffle pizza. Overall, I'd say the portions and value were pretty fair. As for the restaurant service, it was above and beyond. They accommodated me last minute as I wanted to add extra seats and I was also able to bring in my own birthday cake.

The selection of teas was good and there were both caffeinated and decaffeinated options so everyone could select something they liked. The only criticism I have is some of the flavour combinations were not well thought out. The turkey and cranberry and the smoked salmon with green apple did not pair well. The lobster roll was a standout and the sweet options were delicious. This is still my favourite high tea venue in Toronto. Read more Great experience as always! Chad is always spot on with recommendations. Didn’t believe him about the watermelon salad but turns out it’s terrific.

We had a beautiful evening, the ambience was great, the food, the drinks and the personel were excelent  We visited Harriet’s Rooftop on Saturday around 6:00 PM with a group of three couples. The rooftop atmosphere was pleasant—nice and not too crowded. We were there for snacks and drinks. The food was enjoyable, and I especially liked the shrimp tempura. The cocktails were good as well.
Initially, the service was great. One of our friends didn’t like her food, and the waitress promptly accommodated her request for a change. However, as the evening went on, the service declined. Our order got mixed up, and it took a long time to correct it. One of our friends waited so long for his food that by the time it arrived, we had nearly finished everything else.
We were on a tight schedule for another event and had to follow up multiple times to get our bill sorted out. In the end, the waitress only brought one bill and mentioned she could split it if we wished, which added to the inconvenience.
We were hoping for better service at this rooftop venue. Read more The rooftop has the best vibe overlooking other buildings. Everything about it was nice.  If I had to complain the only I didn’t like were the Lobster Rolls.   The flavor was a bit off. Other than that everything else was great.

But service was god awful that we left to another restaurant for more drinks. Our waitress never introduced herself to us and had an annoyed look when anyone asked her a question. I booked it for my birthday and I always had a good experience but she didn’t even acknowledge anything. Didn’t check up on us, didn’t once smile or try to be friendly even though everyone at the table had manners. For the price you’re paying at, just go next door to the Hotel or downstairs at a better bar! Read more Service was a little slow at a 5:00 reservation we waited awhile to get water and drinks.

A great ambiance and vibe, and the rooftop patio views are on par with the best in the city. We ordered a few drinks, a dozen oysters, veggie tempura, Chili crab roll, and Truffle scallops. There’s many rave reviews about the Bao buns, but the oysters and Truffle scallops are a must. For drinks, get the Manhattan, Purple Rain, and sunset in the 6! You will not be disappointed.

In the past, ordering their bowls or drinks were always a surprisingly good fit for my taste and appetite.

This time, I made the mistake of ordering fries and nachos, I didn't expect the nachos to be that big. 

I felt the waitress could have warned me that the nachos, which were cheap like around $10, was huge so perhaps a  different smaller or more medium sized appetizer would be better.

However, the service was friendly, conversation with the waitress was high quality overall other than that. And the watermelon drink was 10/10 good, nice squeeze of lemon for that kick.

Hope the restaurant provides a good working environment to employees there.  The glow up is definitely an eye catchy drink!

As a non-vegan, I have to say I'm impressed by the taste of the food. Almost every thing I've tried taste really good. Smoothies and juices are very fresh and healthy as well.  Four of us enjoyed energy providing food.  All of us agreed to bring more of our friends to your excellent food.  Location of Eglinton Ave just east of Yonge street is good.

Recommendations are graciously offered and should be accepted. The food was fresh, colorful, balanced, carefully crafted, and delicious. We had eight dishes and two desserts.

Delicious good with high quality products from the food to the wines  Amazing experience. Delightful service and exquisite food  Did not enjoy the taste of the food served. To be fair, I believe it isn't a case of bad food quality but rather a question of palate.

No doubt we will be back soon  Very nice place to go, nice atmosphere and a great place to go for date night.  Strolling along Wellington St. toward La Fenice we noticed so many restaurants sitting empty, likely a result of recent economic challenges in Canada. Arriving at La Fenice there were a few other parties enjoying dinner and as the evening progressed we overheard many pleased customers giving their thanks to the staff. 

My lovely wife and I enjoyed a quiet meal with pleasant back ground music. The only “issue” may have been the air conditioning which was pretty chilly, seated against the wall under the vent. 

The menu is wide ranging with options that should offer something for everyone.  We started by sharing the grilled squid and shrimp appetizers after being presented with a basket of bread and a small bruschetta appetizer.  We enjoyed a bottle of Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon with our meal. 

For our main course, my wife had the mixed seafood linguine and I enjoyed the rack of lamb. The linguine was a very healthy portion which was a bit too much for my wife to finish. The rack of lamb consisted of three delicious chops and some seasonal vegetables. 

My wife had saved room for the tiramisu which she thoroughly enjoyed while opted for the afagato, vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over. 

All in all, we enjoyed all of the food very much, all prepared and presented very well. Our server, although seemingly new, was very pleasant and engaging.

A little loud for conversation but that's minor. Food was delicious.

The food was all incredible and very creative .  Everything was absolutely delicious.  High tea was good - service quite slow and not as attentive as I would like for the price.  Everything was set up lovely. The staff were very kind but the service overall was pretty slow. We got to our reservation on time & it took almost 20 min for someone to come greet us & offer us drinks. Then we had to wait about another half an hour to get our high-tea service started. Once the food arrived I noticed they did not include my preference request. The hotel called me about 2-days prior to check for any allergies & preferences. I kindly asked for no pork for myself & if they could switch it with another vegetarian option, they said it wouldn’t be a problem. So I brought it up to the waitress once she went over the food descriptions & reminded her that I do not eat pork & she said she would bring out some other options. I could only eat a few of the items & the waitress never ended up bringing my substitution.

We did the promo high tea in partnership with Cathay Pacific featuring food inspired by Hong Kong. The food & tea were excellent & the complementary sparkling wine was a nice touch. Service was pleasant but a wee bit slow & inattentive. This was mostly fine as we were in zero rush; however it was a bit irritating that we were never offered the ballot to win the trip to Hong Kong (which was the whole point of the promo) nor proactively checked on to see if we needed anything (we had to flag down the server more than a few times for stuff that's usually quite standard everywhere like hot water refills for our tea). Anyway, overall a very nice leisurely afternoon and I'll likely go again for their regular high tea sometime. Read more The afternoon tea is not as good as a few years ago, savory foods are bad.

Ambiance was good, food was okay, and service was terrible.

When arrived, the host told us about the two hour table limit. Absolutely not a problem. Given the time constraint, it was strange that it took 30mins for a server to come greet us and take an order. We tried to politely catch the waiter to order refreshments, but after a couple attempts it started to feel like we were an inconvenience.

Shortly after our first round of drinks came out, a man comes to our table to warn us that there is 1hr left in the reservation. We appreciated the heads up, but it left us feeling rushed out and unwanted since we hadn’t even received the mains yet or had been asked if we wanted a second drink. Given this strange atmosphere we settled as quickly as possible, and went somewhere else for a second cocktail and dessert. 

As for food, for the high price we expected it to be better. Paid $60 for the striploin. It was cooked medium-rare as requested; however, the grill they were using must have been dirty as there was an overpowering “char” taste that tainted the flavor. The accompanying spinach had no dressing or seasoning, it was almost as if it was simply taken it out of the package and plated it. Maybe it was an off day, but sadly we won’t be back to find out.

We enjoyed our meal celebrating a birthday quite a lot! We really would recommend the Caesar salad - you won’t regret it! We will definitely be back!  Amazing French food! The foie gras was so smooth and airy! Tarragon added to the steak tartare was a welcome surprise!  Truly unenjoyable experience, the “restaurant” is open part of the hotel, completely empty with music jacked up super loud, didnt match the ambience. The waitress decides to sit us at a corner table of a walkway in the very back which made no sense and then allowed us to chose a seat that was right by the attendent cart where the point of order machine was and storage of cutlery and where they put the used dishes so our waitor was constantly beside us distrupting our conversation with loud noises clanging of dishware and cutlery. Our waitor was extremely cold and unfriendly like he didn’t want be there, no smile, just very matter of fact lets get this going and done type attitude, so strange. I ordered the fish & chips - fish was previously frozen, was wet and had no flavour, fries were good. Escagot had good garlic butter flavour and nice warmed brioche. Steak with caeser salad side was good. Would not return or recommend. Read more The food was out of this world - exceeded all my expectations, honestly.

Will do it again  We were happy with the fixed menu for Thanksgiving. The main dish was very delicious, and the appetizer was good, but it could have been better  We found Eataly Sherway to be underwhelming. We were very excited to try it after having great experiences at other Eataly restaurants but this one is a miss. The service was average, the food was ok but some of it wasn’t cooked well. All in all it was ok and I’d probably go back because we love the concept but there is plenty of room for improvement in the restaurant.  Excellent food and service. Jose was a fantastic server. We will return!  The waiter was pushy and was not attentive.   He poured water after our meal was almost done.  He didn't check how we were doing.  Overall really disappointed with the service. For those thinking of having dinner here, go somewhere else.  Lunch was very good, had chips de panelle and margherita pizza.  Server, Yevhenia was efficient & very helpful.  The service was attentive and the food was enjoyable. The arancini were tasty. The mushroom ragu and pappardelle was good but the noodles were much wider than normal pappardelle and sort of overpowered the dish. The spinach ravioli was good and the tomato sauce was very fresh. We were there quite early and the noise level was acceptable. Still aware of being in a mall restaurant. Not much ambiance. Read more Tasty food. Quick service. Pleasant ambiance. Will be back.  Very poor experience and I will give the benefit of doubt and this could be an exception… but here is how went down:

- we booked the table for 9pm on a Saturday evening but arrived at 8:15pm requesting for an earlier table - funny enough they asked walkins that table will be available in 20 mins wait but asked us to come back at 9pm - inexperienced front desk host

- table assigned and seated at 9pm but no server… after 15 mins had to waive out to a server to get their attention. Server says it’s not my section but I will help - I was wondering why am I being given the excuse cause I never assigned sections, I just need someone to walk me through the menu and take my order

- No water arrived on our table upon seating - had to request for a glass of water…

- order the bread for the table - did not arrive - they forgot

- pasta was served and no one offered the parmesan cheese over the pasta…

The serving sizes are small so you may need to order more that you think.…

The good part:
- our server who finally ordered to serve was decent and made some good and some ok suggestions but was pleasant
- the food was quite good - pesto gnocchi and Pizzas were very good…
- given the experience the server knocked off the 1st pizza from the bill which was a good gesture so hence I said it’s probably was an exception or our bad luck… will give it one more chance.. Read more I rarely leave reviews but feel compelled to write this as I can’t remember the last time we had such shockingly poor service. Our waitress was not just curt, she was actually insulting.

Fabulous food. Service staff are great. Defiantly going to return.  Great place you should try it and have the branzino  Overall I was a little disappointed with the food options available for someone with a gluten and dairy intolerance. I understand this is an Italian restaurant but I don’t remember the last time I’ve been to a restaurant in the city and it being such a struggle to find a meal that I could eat. They also had on their menu at the bottom “tell the server if you have any allergies” but when I did, there were no recommendations given or even an alternative option for the pasta dishes so I’m confused what allergies they could accommodate?

Before visiting I did look at their menu and saw they had steak so I knew that’s what I was going to get but when I got to the restaurant unfortunately they didn’t have that on their menu. I went with the fish which they had to remove part of the dish because it had dairy so I was basically just left with a piece of fish and mushrooms which were extremely salty.

My partner was able to eat the pasta, focaccia and arancini which he said were subpar.

I don’t know I just expect a little bit more inclusiveness with menu options especially in 2024. Read more Very small menu; not alot of offerings in regards to appetizers/mains…only one main course dish, of the 4 antipasti 1 was bread and one was olives. What we had was good and the portions were good. Arancini fell flat; caccio Pepe felt very “tanic”. Server brought the bill when we didn’t ask for it so we felt rushed to leave, no real introductions regarding  whom was serving us so it wasn’t a very personalized service.

Overall, our experience was quite good (on my birthday) but a couple of things did (no longer) meet our standards expected of a nice, relatively expensive restaurant; there were only three items on the desert menu, one of which was a chocolate mousse. Unfortunately, this could not be called a 'mousse' (which is supposed to be light and airy) as it was dense and very heavy. We also found the wine prices too pricey for the 5oz and 7oz glasses. While the service was friendly, it was somewhat lacking in its personal approach and a bit aloof. Read more Fantastic dinner! Emma and the entire team were outstanding as usual. Thanks for a great night.  Nice date spot, food was good. Only a few tables and service could have been slightly better. Had to ask for plates for appetizer. Steak frites- a bit difficult to cut into the steak as it was too rare but was still tasty. Steak tartar and caesar salad were on point.  Cozy atmosphere, friendly service and great food!  Greta Solomon’s never disappoints.  Lovely. Delicious menu, fantastic staff. Will be back!  After we finished dining, the Chef came to our table to chat.  She was extremely pleasant and friendly and inquisitive.  A very nice person.  One of my favourite places in Leslieville. Food is amazing. Service is incredible. Xoxo  Darlene and her staff always provide a wonderful experience!  Absolutely delicious, we had an amazing time. Very tasty food, good wine, great service and atmosphere.  We enjoyed the experience. The service was attentive and friendly, the food was good. The restaurant was full which gave a nice vibe. I would have enjoyed a cooler restaurant as it was a very humid day and we opted to sit inside but it was very muggy as they had everything open to the street.

Very slow service - we had to ask for a to-go box so we didn't miss our movie.  It's really only accessible if you have VIP seats for a movie, contrary to what the website says. Also, if you book IMAX be aware it is not in the VIP section so you have to go back downstairs to get to your theatre.  

We had four servers standing around talking to each other while our server covered an entire section. Bar staff was similar - it took almost 15 minutes for us to get our drink order in spite of 4 staff behind the bar and there were only 5 tables occupied.  This points to absent or poor management in my opinion.

Go to a good restaurant in the Young/Dundas area and walk over for your movie instead. Read more Concession drinks are better and come with refills. Restaurant requires separate drinks served in a small glass. End up paying for drinks twice.  Well they didn’t know we were coming which was odd. And in fact a booking isn’t actually needed. So a bit of a waste of time and effort to make one to be honest. Just pay for VIP tickets and go.  Amazing service (courteous and accomodating staff) but food and cocktails were bland.  Had a great experience and made for a great appetizer to our evening.  Went to Cineplex for $5 tacos and $10 margaritas. The margaritas were good. Good amount of alcohol to slushi mix.

However, the 'Captive Audience / Money Grab approach' is wrong on all levels.

Only real complaint t is being charged $4 for each refill of soda water without being informed when we asked for refills…which were super necessary given how heavily laden the tuna tostada was with habaneros.  The restaurant is cute, but you pay quite a lot for a very little amount of food. Also, the menu is very limited.  ￼  The food was average, the service was faster than other reviews have mentioned.

In a pleasant setting make a wonderful dining experience. This was our third visit to Adega - it never disappoints. We will be back.  This longstanding Toronto institution still maintains the highest standard of Portuguese cooking and never fails to deliver. The prix fixe is great.  Adega is my hands down favorite restaurant in Toronto!  This place never disappoints. Food is delicious, service is pleasant.  Adega's manager and host Marco is incredibly beyond words in his most friendly and warm approach to customer satisfaction. His entire staff and most notably Fernando are always aware of the diners' needs and react even before there is a need to get their attention.  An example, replacing a napkin that fell to the floor with a clean before I could even pick it up. The staff member doing this was not even our waiter.
We have been going to Adega for several years and can only offer the highest recommendation for the delicious food and for Marco and his staff.  We can;t wait to return.

Thanks for opening next door to my house!  See you soon! Bring back sake bombs!  We took our colleague for a birthday lunch today! The service we received and thoughtfulness from the staff made her experience incredible. Food was delicious! Thank you!!  We tried the assorted tempura, assorted sushi and carbonara udon! The food was so good and fresh! We even got free dessert for posting a google review 😁 our server was so nice and friendly !  After an excellent dining experience at the original location, I brought five friends to this location for a birthday meal together on a Sunday. The very first thing told to us was that a 20% gratuity would be added for a group our size, which seemed excessive for a group of 6, and only four bills would be allowed. We had quite a wait for placing our drink order, and ultimately did not receive drinks until we had been seated for 45 minutes, only shortly before our food arrived. As before, the food was fantastic. However, at no point were we offered another drink, and our water glasses sat empty for at least 30 minutes. When we flagged down our waitress for the bill, we sat for another 20 minutes, despite the restaurant being fairly empty. At this point I expressed concerned about the auto gratuity given the lack lustre service, and was told that the waitress didn’t care about tips and would be paid either way. The manager came to speak to us, and mostly disagree about how long the drinks took. We then had to ask for the bills again, and the only compensation offered was a removal of the 20% gratuity. Oh, and the birthday dessert we had forgotten about because we had been ready to leave for some time. All that to say, it is worthwhile to travel further to the original location so the service quality will match that of the food. The staff here clearly isn’t interested in providing a positive experience, even for a birthday dinner. Read more Unbelievable sushi
Service was super attentive and kind  We had a wonderful time and the dishes we ordered were absolutely yummy! The service was great too. Just an aside, the plates and glass slip on the wooden table, can I recommend a placemat? Haha! But other than that it was lovely!  Very surprised with this fantastic sushi restaurant. The servers were awesome!  Highly recommend.  Great food and service! Beautiful presentation and very flavorful!  Went as a group of 4 which is conveniently because we all had a chance to try practically everything  on the menu.

We tried all their sushis - had the chef’s selection, kinka roll and red tuna roll — and each of the sushis were uniquely delicious!

We ordered several shareables — karage, fries, tofu, short rib — and you almost don’t want to share them because they’re so good!

Very flavourful and good quantity! We had two types of tacos, chips with guacamole and a mojito! Best mojito in Toronto that I have had.

The two drawbacks I found: they would not substitute foods for dietary restrictions. I asked for grilled shrimp instead of the breaded (which was available on the menu) and they would not substitute.

We then ordered two cappuccinos. One regular milk and the other oat or almond due to dietary restriction’s.  They did not have either oat or almond and then returned saying they were out of milk all together . This was disappointing.

I think if they were more flexible with peoples dietary restrictions, had variations to offer and were stocked this restaurant would be great.

We arrived just before 5pm with over 1 hour and 45 minutes to spare to eat dinner (in order to make it to our nearby show). The restaurant was extremely understaffed. There was barely any toilet paper in the washroom which desperately needed servicing ( I went at the start and end of our reservation and nothing had been done). We ordered our drinks and an appetizer to begin with and everything seemed fine (they arrived quickly).  Our waiter was kind/friendly but seemed very anxious and rushed. As we were finishing our appetizer we ordered our meal. This is when the problems started. At 6pm our waiter said that our meals would be out at any minute. At 6:10pm I questioned him and he said that he would get them. We all had our meals by 6:20pm (I asked to pay our bill right away because I was concerned about getting out by 6:45pm). My sister's order was wrong (they added chicken to her vegetarian nachos). We let our waiter know that she would eat around the chicken because we were in a rush (and we were not charged for the chicken which was acceptable). A waitress at a table near us dropped her heavy tray near me and glass flew everywhere including towards my food. I felt bad for her and I am sure that she was rushing. We had already paid for our meal and we were in a rush at this point. I did not finish my food. When we left the restaurant I let the girl a the front desk know that the toilets needed servicing and that overall we had a bad experience due to understaffing. It was not our waiters fault.

Beers came out quickly but we sat there not asked if we wanted food or anything else for another 20-25 minutes. Then WE had to find our waiter to get our bill to pay. It was horrible. Would never ever return. Read more Excellent selection of beers on tap.

The only complaint that I have are the fruit flies that we were constantly swatting away. Other than that it would have been a perfect birthday evening.  Great Resturant! Affordable eats and amazing drinks.  Delicious food, interesting menu and an enticing array of cocktails (driving later so only one for me, but I tasted my son’s and it was equally appealing).
Server was friendly and informative, present when needed and never intrusive; food and drink came quickly even at prime brunch time (noon res) when the place seemed at least ¾ full. Would definitely return when in town; fun atmosphere for cocktails, and I’d like to sample the dinner menu.

The food was incredible, drinks were so refreshing, and the staff was incredibly lovely as well  We did not get appetizers because we came during the happy hour, but the dinner was great.  A Parkdale Gem. The Brunch services that we have enjoyed were always on Point. Service and Food. The new dinner menu we had last evening was very well executed. All seven courses were outstanding. Great value . The owner has also put together a very nice cocktail and wine list. Highly recommend.  Simpl things is one of my favourite places in the city. Chef Cody’s menus are always delicious. I got to try their new concept for the first time recently and I was blown away. Highly recommend that you eat here! Cocktails are a huge highlight too. Will definitely be back.

Love the vibe, check it out!!  Ardo and it’s staff are lovely and everything we had was amazing. Such a delightful spot for dinner  Bar Ardo is a local haunt where either a hostess, server or Chef himself may greet you at the door. It’s a hipper, livelier crowd with good music ambiance, clean walls, chic art with views of streetcars passing, a true neighbourhood joint. The food is Sicilian inspired as this is were the Chef originates and from the citrus flavoured raw scallop to the beautiful confit artichoke, to the lemon mayo to dip our fries in (which ironically worked incredibly well with our full body red wine) as a side to our steak, to the lemon Tiramisu, a touch of Sicily on King street in every dish. I may recommend you share a few dishes to explore the different flavours of Sicily and to fill yourself, this is not a one pasta course and done restaurant, but in Sicily this is how it’s done. In typical Saturday night restaurant standards when it gets busy service can take a bit of a hit, our table wasn’t ready when we arrived, but once we were seated the evening was great.

Best casual Italian in the six  First, let me say that the service and servers were THE BEST. The food was ok. We chose Pizza Libretto because people said they’d “nailed the gluten free crust” and they have vegan options. The gluten free crust was undercooked and not yummy said my husband. FYI - he orders gfree pizza all over the world. As a vegan, I had their impossible vegan. I wish I’d ordered no cheese instead of the house made vegan cheese as it wasn’t good.

Another example of how we've had to settle for mediocre at best. Food - ok. Atmosphere - good. Service - meh

FOOD
The food was mostly good for this restaurant.  I ordered the Peppered Beef which was flavourful, but overcooked.  My friends ordered chicken and fish, which was nice, but some items smelled awful.  The menu was confusing and unnecessarily complex with separating each food group (i.e. rice, sauce, etc) instead of just creating complete meals.

DECOR
The relaxed lounge feel is great for a club. However, this establishment claims to be a restaurant.  The low tables in the booths, made it uncomfortable to eat.  There were issues with etiquette on cutlery placement. No accessibility.

SERVICE
The servers clearly did not understand restaurant and hospitality etiquette.  Most were too busy chatting behind the bar, then understanding hospitality protocol.  This restaurant failed the sniff test on decent restaurants by:

     > Had to wait 5 minutes for a hostess to acknowledge and seat me when I entered
     > Hostess/Server failed to communicate properly at onset like asking ""do you have a reservation?"", ""table for ?""...just basic sentences to acknowledge a human being entering your establishment.
     > Once full party arrived, took too long to attend to table, take orders, etc
     >  1 hour to receive appetizer :-(
     > Too long to take orders (we were seated in front of bar for an hour and had to flag the servers down to notice us)
     > Failed to bring food genres together (brought 1 person's entree at a time, with nearly 10 minute gaps between each entree, leaving the other members without food.  So the party could not eat together.)
and more.....

I would advise the owner and staff to take a course in hospitality and restaurant management to learn to manage and run a restaurant and provide good customer service.  If they just want to cook and sell food, they should transition to take out and/or catering (drop off without service). Read more I was unexpectedly impressed by the taste of the food. Most Nigerians meal are oily and salty. All the dishes ordered were neither salty nor oily. Right kind of  ‘spicy’ too, not too hot 🥵 .
Overall nice ambiance and good service. Polite, warm and respectful. Most restaurants in Canada (African or not ) are impersonal, you just wanna eat and get out. Here you just wanna sit some more. Read more A time was had I’d definitely recommend this spot  Great place to unwind and have fun, the food was amazing.  Favorite Nigerian food downtown. Great vibe and ambiance too  Friendly staff, however, they could have been more attentive. We placed our food order first per our request then asked for the drink menu. Server never returned to inquire if we decided on a drink (which we did) to place our order. In fact server never returned to ask how our food was (Note, our server did not bring out our food). Our food request for a very spicy suya was not considered even though the server made it appear that it was possible to receive that accommodation? Food was not impressing. We got the suya platter and suya pasta and suya was bland while pasta just tasted like jar alfredo, although good, did not deliver on the fusion of the suya flavour portion of the dish. Music was extremely low for after 9pm on a Saturday. It ultimately gave snooze fest elevator music. I think this place would make a great take out spot but it lacked in person vibes, which very well could have just been that night though. Didn’t stay long enough to see the lounge transition to its party portion but unfortunately, the venue did not match the TikTok reviews so not confident that I will be returning. Read more We had a reservation for two to dine and possibly stay for drinks. After being seated, we were informed that the kitchen was out of food. We ordered drinks and decided to get a table with a bottle once the dining area cleared. Before settling our bill, we ordered two more cocktails while waiting for the club setup. At that point, we settled our bill for the cocktails—one of which hadn’t been served yet—and prepaid for the bottle.
After payment, we didn’t receive our drinks, nor did we see our server. We ended up getting a drink at the bar while waiting for the bottle. At the end of the night, we stepped away from our table to use the restroom, only to return and find our bottle gone, with not even a bottle of water left for us. Meanwhile, male patrons were treated with a higher standard, with their leftover bottles being packaged to go. I will never return to an establishment that treats women in such a way.

We came here on Sunday, 12pm. Very quiet.

Cute backyard patio. Read more Interesting take on tacos. Very tasty, especially like the shrimp and pescado  White wine and beer not cold enough 
Tacos not spicy enough. We weren’t offered sauces to accompany dishes  Tl;dr....just go to this place for the tacos.  They are legit!

I wish someone had told me that before.  Because the nachos were awful (squirt cheese...really?!) and the drinks way too sweet and overpriced.  Service was friendly, but slow as the servers also had to make the drinks and run the till.  Maybe someone called out the night we were there, but if not...better to hire one more staff to make the drinks at very least!

Along with the tacos being very good...the ceviche was also quite nice.  They do also make a good guac.    The flan was also a disappointment...way too dense and the dulce de leche sauce tasted very off. Read more Definitely planning a meal back. We loved it! Great drinks, food and ambience.

I ofcourse did not accept that, I responded that I would wait for a table and she said they didn’t know how long the wait was and I was fine with the wait inspite of having a reservation.

Loved the atmosphere.  Food, drinks and vibe we're great! There is no signage downstairs/outside so it makes it very confusing to find. We were also not given cocktail menus when we sat down and then when we asked for some they included a different food menu. Our server was kind of awkward and seemed annoyed. Overall, wed give it another try.  Food was not great. Drink good though! Don’t go for food. Vibe was ok. Very crowded by 10 which was good but then crowd was kinda boring & low energy. Maybe DJ on another night would liven up crowd  We went for the Friends with Benefits live show and had a fantastic time. Great cocktails and shots. Great ambience. Looking forward to coming back to explore more here.

This isn’t my first time coming to Papi Chulos but I was quite disappointed when I dined last night. The restaurant was half full yet my table had difficulty getting our server to assist us with ordering anything and she would spend large amounts of time by the drink stand talking to her other coworker.

Birria was great though xx Read more Hello
Food. Really lacked flavour - guacamole was not great - served in a paper cup.
The chips that went with it were amazing
I had a fish taco and there was almost no fish and the taco was stale.
Serving everything on plastic or paper isn’t ideal.

Service - the staff was very pleasant however we had to ask several times for more things.

Drinks - disappointment- they use syrup in their drinks - I think using fresh lime makes more sense in an authentic Mexican restaurant

Overall disappointing as it has great reviews and I had been in the past And liked it Read more The service started off rough. I was the first one of my party to arrive and despite their entire restaurant being dead at this time they refused to sit me until my entire party arrived. At that point I might as well have not made a reservation. The woman I had originally spoked to said she would talk to her manager, left and then never came back. It wasn’t till the two ladies who were already outside came and talked to me we were finally seated (however, with resistance)

However, after that one hiccup, the drinks and food were delicious and were well priced for a restaurant in Ossington. And the lady serving us, paid attention to both my table and the other party we reserved with.

All around great experience just wish it did not start off so rocky. Would come back again!

Highly recommended.  Food was great.my only issue was that my meal came with vegetables and potatoes. I asked to have some extra veg instead of the potatoes and they wouldn’t do it u less I paid more. I decided to get the extra vegetables, ( looked like maybe 1/2 a carrot and 1-2 green beans). The charge o the bill was $5 for about .10 worth of extra veg. Other than that the meal was great.  The food was delicious, the restaurant was hopping so a bit noisy but not offensively so.

Just like Nonna would make  We arrived early, asked to be switched to rooftop patio which we got. Service staff were very friendly and attentive.
The menu options older traditional fare which we normally enjoy. Surprisingly for the cocktails they were out of several spirits (and the LCBO strike ended a couple weeks back). What we did drink was good.
We had the Bruscetta for an app, the flavours were off and tomatoes over ripe and soft. Was not very good.
Partner has a pizza, was little under cooked, the sauce had no flavour or seasonings and was acidic and the artichoke were huge chunks, too big to put in to mouth. I had the Chicken Parm but swapped the spaghetti for fettuccine. The chicken was so hard and dry almost like it was either microwaved or recooked a second time when reheating, the pasta noodles half very hard (not undercooked but dry like they were exposed in an oven).

Waited a long time for a server to come for our drink order (then were told no rum available at the bar- no explanation and no alternatives offered).  Server disappeared then returned with only one of three drinks.   Had to go find the server when the rest of the members of our party arrived.  Waited a long time for the drinks again, and then a long time for a new server to take our food order.
It was a very hot late afternoon.  It was clear it was hot at our table, but there was no offer to move us to a shady table, and staff saw us so infrequently, by the time we were going to ask other table options were gone.

I went for a late dinner with a few girlfriends and we were very happy with our meals. The only thing that would have made the experience better is if they had a drink and dessert menu. I asked for these and they did not have any.  Great service and delicious food at this cozy lounge restaurant.  Highly recommend! Will be coming back for sure!  My family and I went to MiM restaurant in Vaughan to celebrate an anniversary. The restaurant was empty when we arrived at 6:30. A young, inexperienced server sat us at our table and asked if we would like water. So far, so good. She brought the water to our table. Bottled water. She hadn’t mentioned the water was bottled or that we would be charged for it. We were told to scan the barcode on the table to see the menu. We had a few people in our party who prefer paper menu’s, but that was not an option. After ordering, we waited over an hour to receive our food. Our server did not let us know there would be a delay or offer any type of bread and butter, garlic bread, or anything similar. Being what we thought was an Italian restaurant, we found this odd. My husband finally asked our server if we could order bread and she said she didn’t know, but would ask. Strange, but OK. It turns out the only bread they have available is pita. We declined. When our food finally came, we were disappointed. Three people in our party ordered pizza. The quality was that of a frozen supermarket pizza. For $25, it’s a rip off. 2 others enjoyed their pasta. I had lasagna which was “meh.” The server didn’t come to check on us one time, or clear away any dishes. Like I said earlier, the restaurant was empty, literally empty. When presented with the cheque, we noticed that a $28 service charge had been added. When questioned about it, we were told it was a fee for having made a reservation. We argued about it because it wasn’t made clear to us that making a reservation would cost $28. If I had known this I would have chosen another restaurant. The charge was removed when we told the manager we would just take it off the tip. The meal, with tip, was just over $200 for 6 people. No bread, appetizers, wine or dessert. We didn’t enjoy it and we won’t ever go back. Read more Thanks MIM lounge and restaurant management.

Helpful and most personable  Really great and attentive service. Food was mediocre.  I’ve been dining here since it opened. Sadly, everything has gone downhill and seems to continue that way. Service is subpar with our waitress forgetting order items, mixing plates up, and having to go to the kitchen area to ask for my bill. It’s unfortunate, but they either retrain their staff and pay attention to the food they serve or simply close up shop. 3/10  The service, quality of food and price was wonderful  Samantha was a terrific server tonight.  Food was great. Music not too loud. All in all, a lovely evening with a friend.  Love the outdoor patio. Great service. Low noise level. Good food with lots of choices.

Drinks were made without skimping on the alcohol. The restaurant looks like it was recently refurbished and has a welcoming, cool vibe.

And the food was perfect temperature and our server provided exceptional service.  My wife’s tuna poke bowl was excellent.

It was fine if the prices were lower but my 13 dollar truffle fries were normal fries with parmesan sprinkled on top, my friends 19 dollar taco salad was lettuce, beef, cheese and sour cream with none of the other vegetables/toppings advertised on it and the one persons veggie quesadilla was only cheese and canned jalapeños. If prices were lower I would understand the arena concession type food but it is decently expensive for what you get. Next time I will just get a drink and popcorn! Read more Good and convenient place to eat.  Food was very tasty.  Great dinner place for a pre movie meal and drink!  Food was god awful, expensive and cold.

Food selection is obviously limited to movie theater food options but still decent for a quick bite.  Loved the experience - quiet location when we went, exceptional quality of service for a night out VIP.  Don't expect gourmet food. Simple and tasty. A bit small for the price.  Definitely not worth the money. Im glad i went once for the experience, but definitely would not do it again  Great for a quick bite, great selection. Pub food.  The food is thawed from frozen, not fresh. All processed. The drinks were good though.  The ambiance was great.  The restaurant is lots quieter than the other restaurants in the complex.  The service was terrible. We ordered drinks that came after 20 minutes and only then because we complained.   The waiter tried to have us settle the bill when we were halfway through our meal.

I ordered the Pesto Chicken Club. It was on 2 large pieces of bread, and cut in half. I ate the first half which didn't seem to have much chicken. Before eating the second half, I open the sandwich and saw there was a small piece of chicken sitting on a lone piece of tomato. The chicken was not much bigger than a toonie and covered less than a 1/4 of the bread. Our waitress was walking by and asked if everything is OK. I asked if there is a chicken shortage in the kitchen. She said she will let the kitchen know and walked away. That was the end of it. I ate the rest of my pesto and lettuce sandwich and the fries.

This was probably one of the worst experiences that I had. We came here for a birthday celebration (which we called in advance to notify) and left a note in opentable but none of the staff took time to review. The restaurant was essentially empty and both waitresses did not provide any care in the service that they provided. It felt that we were an inconvenience to them. They prematurely took our menus and keep us waiting to refill our water. For a restaurant that was not busy, they made it very clear that they were busy for us. For a restaurant located near St. Lawrence market, it might as well make its customers grab the food themselves. The food was stellar and absolutely refreshing (from the appetizer, main dishes and dessert). The waitress who served us did not coordinate the birthday celebration well and kept a stale face throughout our whole time there. For a family that came from Brampton for a special celebration, Bindia made a special moment very unpleasant and distasteful (again, the food was stellar).

My only small caveat to the whole experience is that line management at the entrance could’ve been smoother, as well as the seating. My friend and I had a reservation, and one of us was a bit early, but she shouldn't have had to wait for 20 minutes to be seated as the table was clearly available.

One came good and another had burnt sides. The fennel pear and orange walnut salad wasn’t. There were no fennel but endives instead and dressing was too little making it bland. My friend has macaroni and cheese but there were not enough cheese. The kale salad was good and flavourful. The desserts were bad. The tiramisu was so sweet and not good.

I've never even eaten a MEDIOCRE meal here. Every single time I eat at QMP, I am blissfully happy. 

Most people don't dream about kale. Most people SHOULDN'T dream about kale. But QMP's grilled kale salad is SO ridiculously delicious, you'll dream about it, you'll crave it; you'll rave about it to your friends until they go and try it.

Pizzas with hints of chili and touches of hot honey and a pillowy outer crust but a thin pie. It's heavenly.

The pulled pork added the perfect sweetness to the salt and savory pizza.  The arugula on top was a great touch.  Tiramisu was great too. Would highly recommend 10/10  Great service, great food. Very clean and good atmosphere  This review is simply for our experience last night, April 26. We've eaten there 10+ times and it's been much better. Food is always good. Service is always kind, but often a little frazzled or ... just off sometimes. 

We had a reservation for 7:30. Came with our two kids after our youngest daughter's swimming lesson. Were seated swiftly. Then continued to wait for upwards of 10 minutes for someone, ANYONE, to serve us. Water, kids' menus, drink order, anything. But nothing. Wait staff seemed busy, sure, but after that period of time with at least one very hungry kid you start to think you're invisible, or worse, somehow leprosy-filled, as the wait staff continued to pass by, pass by, pass by. At some point you just say: OK, time to move on. Which we did. Packed up the kids and left. My wife said a little something to the person who seated us, nothing unkind but clearly frustrated.

Service here has edged on this before. I don't think it's a matter of them being unkind or unprofessional. I think it's either a situation where ... I've often wondered if it's a matter of brinksmanship between the wait staff. Nobody's been assigned a table, so the wait staff kind of just avoid stepping in an claiming the table, assuming their coworker will. Or they're just overworked. Or something else I can't guess at.

Regardless, after 10+ minutes of sitting unattended, it was time to go. So we did.

Not a common experience. As stated, we've had pleasant meals here before. Food always good. But service, for whatever reason, can often edge towards ... inattentive, I suppose is the most harmless way to state it. Last night it edged over that threshhold into being, as my wife and I saw it, properly unprofessional. In this one instance, a one-star rating suits.

I made a reservation for Mother's Day brunch for myself, my wife, and our toddler. I purposefully made the reservation early (9:30am) to avoid the late-morning brunch, and was happy that they were able to accommodate our need for a high chair. But from the moment we arrived, I could tell that something was off - the staff seem either very inexperienced or very disorganized. Any question we had about the menu or allergens, our waiter had to run to the kitchen to ask because he was clearly new and unfamiliar with the menu. I ordered the classic breakfast and my wife ordered the eggs benedict on gluten free toast. When the food arrived, I was both perplexed and disappointed: my paltry $18 breakfast came with a single piece of dry toast, my 2 scrambled eggs were overcooked, the few home fries I got were room temperature, and the tiny bowl of minced fruit was barely enough to satisfy my daughter. My wife's meal was a little better than mine at least, and her home fries were actually hot and fresh (though one could nitpick that the eggs were not poached long enough). During our meal, no one came around to ask how our food was, to offer any butter/jam/ketchup/salt/pepper, or even to offer to refill our water and coffees (the latter of which has taken a noticeable decline in taste and quality since the hotel switched from Rufino to Propellor coffee). The same inexperienced waitstaff also kept coming around to try and clear our plates before we were finished, as if they were trying to rush us out of there. Then when it came time to pay, our waiter tried to take the machine from me before I even had a chance to look at the bill. Thankfully it was overall not an expensive meal, but coming from people who live in the area and ate at the cafe often before the renovations, there has definitely been a big change since the reopening - and not in a good way.

Our food is made daily, in-house, from whole, natural ingredients.","Eden was an amazing host! We didn’t realize vegan dishes can taste so good. We had the burger, burrito, quinoa onion rings, signature drinks and a cheesecake. All meals, tips and taxes for two people for under $90!  This was my first time dining at this location and it did not disappoint. The food was tasty and fresh. The service was friendly - our server came around just the perfect number of times. The restaurant itself is gorgeous inside. It was quiet which I love because it was easy to carry on a conversation. I know people often don’t want to have vegan food but I highly recommend. You will have healthy food at a reasonable price and will leave feeling satisfied and good. Read more The food was terrible. I had the breakfast sandwich. No seasoning and extremely soggy.

The servers at Fresh are extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Eden was the only server that morning but you would have never known it. She was attentive and engaged with our group in such a friendly manner. We loved meeting her!
Our food was delicious, as always. The brunch options were all so tasty. I come here every time I pop into Toronto!  The onion rings are worth a trip all on their own!  Did not realize it is completely vegan, options do not make you miss meat.  Apps were good but the tacos were tasteless, the drinks took forever and my smoothie came right before we were about to leave $200 for 3 people for lunch and we were ignored and left sitting in an empty restaurant waiting for our food and asking multiple times for drinks. Much better service and food from other locations  Fresh restaurants offer a high quality, gourmet style plant base food with an enchanting atmosphere.

We dined at 9.30 pm and left by 10.30 pm. No one cared to check on the taste of the steak but came to check after everything was finished. Didn’t expect such a below par service.  Lots of healthy varieties of food offerings to satisfy all palates.  Very enjoyable and fresh offerings.

Threes different staff members come to confirm we celebrating birthday, guess less than three is not count or they try challenge us?
Service was very slow, although we were very politely asked at the front if 1,5 hours dining time would be possible for us. 
We got our starters before we got our drinks, and then we wait for main course, and then wait for someone to pick up empty plates.  Not to mention, no one even offered to refill outpr glasses with water. 
By the time we got desert- small gesture for the birthday, it was exact 1.5 hours.

The server was inattentive and barely there; checkups were few and far between, and she would not even wait for a response, although she did seem to have a number of tables. The chili chicken wraps and spinach and artichoke dip were fantastic as per usual. Unfortunately, the seafood cocktail was not available. The blackened cod over gnocchi was terrible; the cod was way too salty, the butter on top was frozen, and the gnocchi seemed just to be put in a can of tomato sauce with no flavor.

Enjoyed myself.  I can honestly say I will never dine at Milestones again. The quality of the food has suffered significantly since the pandemic. Portions have become noticeably smaller for the same price. The famous Bellini has become so incredibly watered down. I should be able to taste the alcohol just a bit. It doesn't taste as rich as it used to just a year ago. I feel like the later in the day it gets, the more watered down they are. I had the butternut squash pasta and I felt soo bad I had to send it back. It was inedible. The sauce had a sour taste to it like was stale and covered in cayenne pepper which made it incredibly spicy. I got chicken wings as a replacement but they were soo incredibly salty I couldn't eat those either but I felt bad and didn't want to send back another item. The server and manager were soo kind to switch my meal no problem. I feel the issue lies in the food freshness and how long leftovers are used,the corporation cutting corners and the chefs.
The service is always amazing. Very disappointed in the food and drinks. Step your game up in that kitchen Read more Our server Christina made our dining experience so special.

Food Service was quite slow, it took a long time to get our food, considering the restaurant had 4 tables when we were seated.
My salmon was not very good, it had a large portion of the fillet that was the end and was very thin which made it over cook considering the thickness of the rest.

Great place to celebrate rhe special moments  Food took over 45 minutes to arrive at the table even though the restaurant was almost empty. Some of the food was cold and some portions were small.

It was quiet when we arrived but as time went on it got a bit too loud - completely understandable since it was a Saturday night.  Overall, great dining experience!!  Had the energy bowl for lunch followed by the cheesecake and both were delicious. We had reserved a table for 5, we had good service and the only down side was parking.

Our reservation was promptly honoured, the service was wonderful and the food was very good. Overall a great night.  Service was terrible. The waiter had a snarky attitude at the beginning of the night. Took him an hour and a half to get out food out. Didn’t bother checking in if it was right because 4/8 of the plates were messed up. Didn’t bother adding the gratuity onto our bills and asked us to manually do it. Got mad when he didn’t get a tip as if he deserved one. Lectured us about tipping laws in canada and was 100% incorrect. If you want a tip, do at least the bare minimum that ur job requires you to and get ur facts straight lol. Read more The restaurant was completely empty, not a single other person in the restaurant, the whole time we were there - a busy Friday night when all of the other restaurants on College were full of people. So, not a pleasant experience but it could be argued that that wasn't the restaurants fault. The ambiance was. It's cold and sterile, without any kind of warmth. The service, despite the fact that there was literally no one else in the restaurant, was barely adequate. The waiter was more focused on his phone. He didn't ask if we were enjoying our meals, if we wanted more water, etc. The food was okay but nothing special - something acceptable since the meal wasn't very expensive. Read more Food  quality is mediocre at best. Most of our party didn’t finish their food.  Slow service.
Bottled fester was not available.
Not recommended  Our second year returning for a family birthday dinner. The owner and staff are welcoming, warm, and very attentive.

The food was delicious and well priced. We enjoyed a great meal in a great place.  We will be back again next year!  The service was extremely poor and we wouldn't recommend this place. After waiting about 30 minutes for our appetizer, we asked our server about it and she said ""It's coming right now."" so we were disappointed that after 80 minutes we still hadn't gotten it, nor our main meal. We decided to just pay for the wine we'd had and leave at that point. When we got our bill we noticed we were charged for the appetizer. I asked why and our server said ""You never received your appetizer???"". I said no and she removed it. While I appreciate that she corrected her mistake immediately, she didn't even realize that we hadn't gotten the appetizer to begin with, which was very inattentive. It was Valentine's Day so we were extremely disappointed with the experience. Maybe it was an off day for them, and maybe it was busier than they expected, but we wouldn't chance going back again. Read more Felt wrong going in my table wasn’t ready and it seem my skin colour couldn’t get me a good seat in the house so I had to wait while seats available and take a small one by the door.

The food was alright nothing to wild, but the wait times for it were insane. I got hungry twice waiting for mains after appetizers came and I order the mains same time, imagine that. It was filling however so not gonna criticize to much Read more It took us more than an hour to get our food after we placed the order. So if you are hungry, go somewhere else.

We didn't like the beef scaloppine, there was no salt, tasted weird.

No complaints. Read more Always have a great experience here, this time however not as great. Felt our waitress would really have rather been doing anything else other than serving us food.

Hopefully this was just a one off and we will return.

We will be returning all calls from Thursday through to Sunday.","Read more A very sad and disappointing buffet experience and not what I expected from my preconceived idea of the Old Mill. I expected much better. 

Our party was five adults. Initially we were placed at what appeared to be a makeshift table for 4 with conference style metal chairs, with an extra chair at one end in what seemed to be a corridor space.  

The two men in our group would have been very tight and it certainly wasn't the ambience I was expecting.  I immediately requested a new table. Fortunately a large spacious round table with much more comfortable chairs was available close by. I don't know why we wouldn't have been put there in the first place.

The buffet servings were mediocre.  It was nicely presented, plentiful quantity, but lacking in quality. There was no fresh roast turkey, a roast lamb which was grossly overcooked and a tasteless roast beef.  There was no fresh hot fish except mixed casserole type dishes. Although each gravy for the roasts had a different name, they tasted identical.  Their yorkshire puddings were dry and unfortunately inedible. 

Much of the food looked very pre made. Although the salad mix lacked life the other salads were certainly varied but poorly presented. And the chicken fingers and french fries offered were definitely from Costco. 

The space was crowded and the decor was bland, kind of like the food. The lighting certainly didn't help and I wouldn't go again. The service was remarkably good (our waiter was Cesar and he was great).  The buffet price ($75 per head) was probably value for money based on the choices but the entire experience was very disappointing for all of us and we each agreed we wouldn't come back.

If you want something easy for a big crowd it would probably be pretty decent. That wasn't what we wanted and I know now to find a different venue for Thanksgiving. Read more Great Thanksgiving Buffet !  Staff was very happy and social, and the food, plentiful !  Thank you ALL !  The buffet was very good. I would definitely go back.  Great food and atmosphere. Highly recommended. Very crowded, but it was a holiday.  Really disappointing with Thanksgiving brunch. The place was overly packed they stuffed as many tables into the places they could, it was so loud you couldn't hear yourself think, the lineups for food were 20 minutes long, and the plates are so small you have to go a couple times to at least get the full meal on your plate, the food wasn't cooked well, it was just like a cattle drive Read more The food was way below par for a thanksgiving buffet at such an iconic place in Toronto.  It was so disappointing, $75 per person for slop.  The carving station was ridiculously packed.  The roast beef carver was yelling at the patrons.  We will never go back after  years of celebrating many family milestones there   They need new chefs, with new ideas and can cook food properly.  I also blame the food &beverage manager for purchasing such low grade quality items.  Overall , really really disappointing Read more This is a great option for those looking to have a great buffet in thanksgiving. Food it's delicious, service is great, and you really get the value for what you pay.  The last few special occasions their food has left very much to be desired. My daughter and I gave it one last try tonight.

Old Mill - whatever Ontario white meat turkey that was it was EXCELLENT. Please bring that back for Christmas along with the herbed potatoes please.

We always go at 7pm. The last four times the food was sitting and cold. This time it was hot and fresh. Things were replenished much faster. Servers were way more attentive than usual.

Keep doing what you did tonight and things will be excellent.

We’ve booked again for Christmas fingers crossed. Read more Excellent night for Thanksgiving. Great food, big selection. Always hot and replenished. Super friendly staff and chef team.

Had a reservation and yet there were no tables available- ok, this happens, we were happy to wait, but they were taking walk-ins and not honouring reservation times!
We sat at the bar to wait, ordered 2 drinks- 1 arrived, the other came over half an hour later- no wait staff came near us. We eventually got a table over 30 mins after our reservation time- then had to chase down our food (which we’d ordered whilst waiting at the bar!). Once we got the pizzas, they were good but not worth the hassle. Read more Very busy.  Waited quite a while for drinks and food.  Pasta and pizza were good but difficult if you’re in a hurry for an event.  Worst food and service I’ve ever had.  Save your money and don’t eat here.  They couldn’t even make basic cocktails correctly.  Even with reservations we were still waiting outside for 30 minutes. Service was terrible. Got drinks wrong. Food took one hour. DO NOT go here pre concert.  Delicious food, lots of options.  Venue isn’t large so probably best to call ahead on game or concert nights if you need a table larger than 5.  I read the other reviews, but since we were here last year, I thought we'd try again anyway. I ditto the other comments about the menu. They have 1 hard copy, but some of the items aren't available at this location. So we scanned the QR code for their menu. When our server, who was great, brought our water, she said they have no chicken, and no beer. What? How can you operate the restaurant lacking such essential supplies? Go down the block to the Shoppers Drug Mart and get some chicken! Anyway, 40 hours after our reservation date and time, I received an email from Open Table - Pizza Rustica had cancelled our reservation! I was able to get into an online chat with Open Table, and Olga was very helpful in adding the reservation back in. Yes, I did mention to the server that I had booked through Open Table. I hadn't even had a chance to leave a review before the restaurant cancelled my reservation. Never going there again. I recommend they turn this restaurant into a Timmies or Starbucks, it would be a lot better use of space. Read more Went to the metro convention center for a conference with 7 colleagues and chose this lunch spot because of their prices and gluten free options. When we arrived, no one else was in the restaurant and all of us were sat quickly. There was only a QR code for the menu but it requests all your contact details before you can access it so we ordered based off the menu on their website while others used the open table menu. Unfortunately they did not have any gluten free options besides salad, so that was disappointing for one party member. It seems to be a common theme in the comments where they're running out of common items so whoever does their ordering might need to revisit their planning skills. The food took a while despite there only being one other couple who arrived after we ordered but it tasted good when we got it. When the bill came, we were shocked that the prices were higher than expected. At least $2 per item more than the  website menu and DOUBLE the open table menu. Rather than honouring the price posted on their website, they said we should have used the QR code, despite it being inaccessible without submitting your personal contact info. They said they would speak with the owner and let him know but that was not helpful in the moment and showed the owner perhaps hasn't trained or empowered his employees to problem solve. We were already late for the afternoon part of the conference so left. Two days later I got a cancellation notification from the restaurant on opentable. Luckily I took a picture of my receipt and their fantastic customer experience representative reinstated the reservation and gave me my 100 points. All of us will not be returning which is unfortunate because the food was good but everything else was a chaotic mess and/ or misleading. Read more The restaurant was extremely busy when we arrived. They seem to take more reservations than they are able to accommodate. Server seemed irritated with the high volume of people coming in and overwhelmed. We waited 20 minutes for drinks and water as they claimed they did not have enough glassware? However, people seated inside the restaurant, who arrived after us hat nice glasses of ice water. Food was decent and the server seemed to get friendlier as the meal went on, and the restaurant less busy not sure we would go back Read more Our reservation was at 5pm on a Friday night and they didn’t have bread, milk, limes and a number of other items so many things we asked for we could not have.

However, they still charged us for the dessert. We ordered the cherry jubilee for two that’s how it comes to the table. But because there were three of us, they made it for three and charged us the extra one. Again, the dessert was supposed to be covered by the manager, but it was forgotten.

We went there often years ago and always had great experiences. Unfortunately, it seems like those days are long gone. The restaurant was filthy, with a strong smell of gas that made us uneasy from the start. When we brought it up to the waitress, she had no idea where the smell was coming from and didn’t seem concerned.

The place was overrun with flies, and the service was painfully slow. We ordered six meals and three appetizers, but the food was downright disgusting. The first appetizer, an avocado spread, arrived frozen like it had been sitting in the fridge from the day before. After sending it back, we were given a fresh one, but that was the only small improvement. The two chicken plates, two salmon plates, burger, and chicken almond dish we ordered were inedible. The burger was burned, the sweet potatoes under the salmon were old and soggy, and the chicken plates were so bad that we couldn’t even finish them.

To top it all off, the bill came to around $300, which was beyond frustrating considering the poor quality of everything.

Love the happy hour specials offered by the restaurant.  Hi, I had asked for regular dining but we’re on high tops in the bar.

The chicken garlic Caesar was disappointing, dry chicken and a very average Caesar salad.  I ordered the Havana Chicken Bowl. The list of ingredients included roasted chickpeas.

Negative was that two of the dishes we wanted were not available even though the restaurant was not busy at all. Will visit again to try the dishes that were unavailable and some others.

My partner ordered a Caesar salad (get the prosciutto add on)…delish! He also ordered pizza and it wasn’t that great. The crust was super hard and not much flavour.

Gnocchi was delicious. Calamari with shrimp was deep fried and not worth the price. An antipasto mix, perhaps with vinaigrette may have been a better option.

Food is deemed to be hot or cold in its effect on the metabolism, and Persian gastronomy looks for a balance between the two, in a way of thinking that’s comparable with the Chinese concept of yin and yang.

I hosted my birthday dinner for 7 here yesterday and I’m so happy that I did. The food was pretty good and the service was good as well. The waitress was very accommodating and kept checking on us. I didn’t order a dessert as I was quite full but 2 waitresses came out with a complimentary dessert with candle to wish me happy birthday. It was such a kind gesture that other restaurants didn’t do when I went for other birthday occasions. All my guests were happy and it didn’t cost much. For 7 ppl the bill was $230(not including tip). I highly recommend coming here for celebrations. Read more Was present for UFC a number of video and sound issues. MISSED SOME of the fights.

No apology by management - when you pay a cover

No apology is not ok! Read more I didn’t enjoy much.I went with friends and one ask for beer and they didn’t bring get long time .Fhey start serving with food .Another friend have hamburger and was very red .The tacos was cold.And just the time to pay they said to be obligations to pay 18% for gorjeta.  It was great. Watch the Canada game with other people was incredible!  I would love to thanks to the waiter and hosts, who made this experience soo great during our Copa America game .. 
And hoping to go back and  See Ecuador vs. Argentina next week..  The streak frites, the service and the environment was amazing overall. Totally recommend!  Our server was great. She forgot a few minor things but they weren’t a big deal. It wasn’t full and the food came at an appropriate time and it was hot and fresh. Only wished they closed the blinds as they opened them when it got dark outside.  Waitresses were nice but it took over 25 mins to come to us, multiple times. I asked for the dessert menu and another guy came with our to go boxes. I flagged down our waitress to ask for our bill. I was just over it.  It was not even that busy. I felt like my mom and I weren’t a priority at all.  I've taken the family several times to this location over the past few years and we generally like it.   I will note that it feels like there is new management running it?  Not sure.

From the last few experiences:

The good: Food is always good in terms of taste, and portions are decent (not small and not excessive).  We did find a hair in a meal once, but in all the times we have gone it only happened that one time and the took the meal off our bill (and I think gave a free dessert as well).  The kids menu is decent as well.

The bad: while service is friendly and all the staff are nice, I find service a bit slow these days.  

Overall: the good outweighs the bad for us, so we have done many times and will continue to do so. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/67682962.webp

I usually like this place.   We went for my husband‘s birthday. The manager came by and asked whose birthday it was then disappeared and that was that. Don’t get me wrong.

We waited 20 mins for the waiter to show up to take our order. And did not come around to ask if we need more water or drinks.
Quite disappointed. Read more The food as ok - fish tacos were very tasty - but my curry fish was way too spicy. I could not eat it. Our server disappeared after taking our order and other runners delivered the food. I had asked for extra tzatziki to help calm the spices - took forever to get. The server finally checked on us after everyone else had finished their meals and was unsympathetic to the heavy spices in my dish. Very disappointing. Read more Great service and food!
Noise level was overwhelming! Extremely difficult to have a conversation or a relaxing meal.  We enjoyed our afternoon at Taylor’s Landing. The food was great and Sam was an exceptional waitress. Thank you l.  This place used to be good but has consistently gone downhill over the last 3 years. The menu has not changed ever and its boring. The appetizers are bland.
Last night my wife and I went there for dinner before a movie and were very disappointed.  We start with 2 cocktails, absolutely watered down and skimped on booze (how do I know? Neither one of us drink often and one drink often gives us a buzz...these were watered down for sure) 
Appetizers - fish tacos and a margherita pizza. First off the fish tacos - one paper thin piece of fish in each taco, heaps of uncut arugula lettuce without cilantro or any flavour, this taco sucks and lacks thought, trust me and 23 bucks for 4 simple tacos with practically no fish in them. We both agree- starter sucks. The pizza, we both agree - not bad.

The mains - Moroccan chicken for her, again skimpy as hell as there is barely any chicken/no meat in this, rip off again, rice is cold. 1 star for this plate.
Mine- would have bought a steak and shrimp but I'm detecting a pattern here tonight and say, I don't trust this place now so I go with the landing burger. It finally gets here. 2 bites in- cold AF. Salty AF!!! Burger - fail.

Kindly tell the waiter, he removed it from the bill,  no issue there. Fries were good. 1 star plate (actually 0)
Naturally we pass on dessert.

Nice waiter but not unlike other times everything is so dang slow here, it's a Sunday evening and not busy but yep super slow, as always here.

At these shops at Don Mills there are other restaurants,  Jack Astors to Joey's being the most expensive. The wife says, Astors has been good let's go there but I'm like no Taylor's is a nicer place let's give it another chance...bad call on our part. We will not spend another penny here. RIP off and has gone downhill.

How do you get back on track, Taylor's Landing?

1 - Faster service.
2 - Change up your menu(same for 5 years and its boring)
3 - Don't rip people off with meat portions. Sides- an afterthought. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/68944500.webp

We ordered beef brisket and another dish, and after waiting 20 minutes, we were only told the brisket was unavailable when the second dish was served. We were then asked to order something else, which we reluctantly did because we had already waited so long. They promised the lamb shoulder would be out in 5 minutes, but it took much longer, and we had already finished the first dish (kebab). To add to the frustration, they forgot to serve the drink we ordered, and there was no apology or acknowledgment of the delays. Given my wife is very pregnant, finding another restaurant last minute wasn’t an option, so we were stuck waiting even longer.

While the food itself was good, the lack of communication, poor service, and failure to manage expectations made for a very disappointing experience. We won’t be returning. Read more This was our first visit to Eat-Meat and the menu was a bit intimidating because they have such a large selection.  But with the help of our server, Angie, we were able to choose a lovely meal.  We had the veggie spring rolls which were amazing, along with chicken shawarma and beef tenderloin.   You will never go hungry as their portions are large and very shareable.  We were looking at what other patrons were choosing for reference - and their presentations are absolutely beautiful.   The only issue we had was our two dinners were delivered 10 minutes apart, but the restaurant was very, very busy and we were in no hurry.   We took home some great left overs to enjoy again.  If you are looking for a wonderful, immersive dinner experience, go to East-Meat Read more The brisket was missing spices and the spices didn’t come until the food was cold.  First time at this restaurant and hat the mix smoked meat grill as suggested by our server Yaseen.  Food was great!  Service a little slow.  Very noisy!  Great value for what you get.  Overall, it was a decent experience. However, my table and I were not happy with the service. The younger staff seemed to be a lot more friendly and accommodating than the older staff. I felt like there was quite a bit of attitude coming from the older staff which made us uncomfortable.  Great food but they need better coordination and staffing  Easy to change and modify and verify reservation. Great experience in terms of food quality, taste and portions. Would like to be back and try the lamb. I ordered briskets and beef ribs both were very nice ,not too much fat and relatively lean meat.  1-So the first thing that upset us was that they force you to buy plastic water bottles and refuse to serve tap water. Despite asking for tap water in a glass, they refused it and later told us that they don’t serve tap water over the weekends. How stupid is that logic?
We are in Canada, land of pure drinking water. We shouldn’t be denied that right by a restaurant owner trying to force you into buying carcinogenic water bottles so he can make money.
2- after dinner, it took us one hour to go through the desert service. We waited for about 40 mins for our desert to be served
3- they brought paper cups for tea. We had to ask them to bring us proper glass cups for hot tea.
4- the food was just ok. We have tried several Turkish places, so far our best is Aghas.
5- not worth it. We won’t be going there again. They’re just doing a massive marketing campaign which is why it is busy. Not sure how long this place will last as in the end, good food and top service runs restaurants, and they lack in these
6- to give you an idea, see attached pic of the Mojito they have on their mocktail menu. It was disgusting Read more Shawarma was poor dry and smelled bad
The bread was cold and not fresh

Everything else was over priced (Mac and cheese balls), did not taste good (lobster pasta) or was overcooked (calamari).  I used to love Pickle Barrel but unfortunately I will not be coming back.  Really bad service from waitress who was also a bartender at time. I don’t know why no one came to check on us I had to keep getting up to find out why food was taking long, to order drinks, to ask for cutlery, salt. Not once did she approach us without waving her over. Even when I did it took time  No wonder this brand is in decline. You’d think they’d up their game to try and reclaim the lost business to Cheesecake Factory but no.

Service was non existent. Virtually empty restaurant and still waited 15 min at host station to be seated. No one apparently working there or aware.

Waited at our table another 20 min before server came by and just asked us for food and drink orders right away.

I asked for a soup to start (aka before my main arrived). Nope it arrived all at once and the soup was like warm at best so clearly had been sitting.

Had also asked for well done fries. Nope same cook as my children’s kids meals.

No other table service throughout the meal. No quality check, no offer for additional drinks, no even water. I had to walk to bar and ask bartender myself.

This was a terrible experience beginning to end. We won’t return. Waste of money and a waste of a night out with my family Read more Food and service were great but the women’s washroom was out of service and the queue for the one disabled single-stall washroom that was unlocked was unbelievable. The condition of that washroom was also horrific given the high traffic volume - garbage piled ankle high after the bin overflowed. I took my  mobility-impaired elderly mother to the washroom and missed an entire course the wait was so long. This is unacceptable for a large family restaurant - Having no functional ladies’ room should have shut the place down until it was rectified. Read more I was visiting Toronto, and met up with an old high school friend who I hadn't seen in 8 years. He had suggested the Pckle Barrel at Yorkdale Mall, as it was halfway in between where we were both residing. Because my friend and I had a lot of news to catch up on, our server was kind enough to give us lots of time to talk before we ordered our food. The food was very good, and our server was attentive, and delivered everything as ordered. it was a great reunion, and I was glad that my friend had suggested the Pickle Barrel. Read more Gathered for a family birthday celebration. The food was well done and enjoyed by all. There was a lag time between our meal and the offering and serving of desert. I had selected birthday as the reason for the reservation but it would appear that info never made it to the restaurant as our server was completely unaware.  Luke was fantastic! He made the experience one of the best for us, our guests and our Children. 
The food was okay, but not as good as on our previous visits. One of my guest and I, we both ordered Pesto Chicken and both came very different. One was nice and saucy with Cherry Tomatoes and the other missed all this, and was very dry.
My wife had buddha bowl, it was dry and no Flavours. On previous occasion, Buddha bowl was delicious. The Nachos were dry, and we could not even eat half of it. On the other hand the Calamari was excellent.. So a few hit and misses on the food side.

The service was a hit and we will definitely go back because of Luke's service, and give them one more chance. Read more Service was very good, but food was subpar.  Sandwich bread wasn’t fresh, some food came cold and my chicken was dry and overcooked.  We took my mother there for an early lunch for her birthday on June 1st at Yorkdale's location. The pasta was hard, for two of the individuals meals the grilled cheese with bacon was burnt, and the food overall was not good. I have been to other Pickel Barrels and never had an issue with the food. 

The server was quite pleasant.

I was very disappointed. Spending $200.00 on lunch and no one was happy with their meal is not good. Read more It was an overall great experience. Will definitely go back.",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/63442376.webp

We came for brunch, made a reservation earlier in the week so that we could get food and watch the Women’s World Cup. When we arrived at 11, we were told that the chef had not arrived yet and brunch would not be available until he did. Our server kept coming to our table to update us that the chef still was not there, and that he would text him. At 12:00, the chef finally arrived, and we were told that he couldn’t offer the brunch menu. Keep in mind, we made a reservation early in the week, and they open on weekends specifically for brunch. We explained this and the server said he could see what the chef would do, and came back and said the brunch menu was open. We didn’t get our food until 1pm, so we waited 2 hours to eat.

The menu was like a fusion of cultural favourites and bar food.  We had the bodega sliders (adobo brioche sliders), chicken katsu burger, smash burger, bang bang cauliflower,  buffalo wings, el pastor tacos, and hand cut fries.  The fries were golden, dense and crisp.  The beers were very good we had their on tap Italian, dark and light.  I forget the fancy names.

Will definitely be back.  Been before. Standard is very high. Location is beautiful.  I've been to Snug Harbour many times.  The food is delicious and the service has always been friendly, professional and accommodating.

I was disappointed today. Our party of 4 was taken to a round table that accommodates 6 people. I went to the front desk to ask to be moved to a table of 4 because conversation was going to be difficult.  The woman quickly responded that they were very busy and that table was the only one available without making an effort to check.  I mentioned there was a table in the corner by the window and once again she responded abruptly that is was reserved.  There were visibly many tables of 4 available throughout the restaurant but this woman made zero effort to fulfill to my request.

I went to the table to regretfully tell my party that we wouldn't be moved.  A waitress approached us and asked if there was anything she could help us with.  I explained the situation and she quickly responded..""Let me see what I can do.""  Within a couple of minutes, she had us seated at the table I originally requested that was supposedly ""reserved.""

La paella vegetariana siempre riquísima, también la más barata en Toronto, siendo ésta tan solo de $25, no acabo de entender por qué los demás restaurantes españoles de por aquí no pueden poner un precio así de barato a sus paellas vegetarianas, que el precio no tiene por qué quitar el buen sabor ni la buena preparación.

Read more Waitress seemed a bit busy, took long to get back to us. Drinks were sent to the wrong table... food took a long time to retrieve.  We always like coming to this State and Main. Why? The steaks are more tender and flavourful than the other steak chains, like the Keg. State and Main have a great selection of appetizers and salads, and more veggie options than other steakhouses. The brussell sprouts are very flavourful. They will even give you a small ceasar salad as a side dish for about $3.  They constantly change up the menu and I was delighted to try the black cod on my last visit. Their salmon is moist and perfectly seasoned. I have found the service quite attentive and staff attitude to be better than average. The place does tend to get noisy on Thursday to Saturday, and getting their earlier in the evening does improve both noise level and service time. Although they do have annoying sports on television screens in the bar area, they are not as loud as they often are and there are plenty of tables where you wont hear them at all. Wine selection is fine. Oh, and if you are an Aeroplan member, purchase a $100 restaurant card for 12,000 points or so online (they take two to three weeks to arrive) and you have a very inexpensive date night to look forward to.

The food was amazing and our server/bartender Josie was outstanding!!  We went to celebrate a special birthday.

The restaurant was quite cold and it is loud as there are no sound absorbing materials.

The club sandwich which was supposed to be toasted, was VERY pale.

The bacon in the burger and in the club sandwich was barely cooked. Otherwise the burger was good.

Fries were very good.
One person ordered salad and got fries instead - then salad was brought and it seemed (and tasted) as if it was from a pre-packaged mix from the grocery store - some of the lettuce was brown.
The fish and chips and the fish tacos were ok.
The lemon crème brûlée was disappointing and was very grainy, greasy and the top was not prepared properly - it should have cracked.
Also ordered cheesecake - also very disappointing.

The wait for the four dinners was lengthy - and the restaurant was not that busy.

Since the desserts we ordered were so disappointing and we were there for a birthday celebration - we ended up going to a nearby restaurant for dessert as we didn’t eat the desserts we ordered.

The quality of the meal was poor considering the cost of the meal. Read more Fairly decent food, very typical hotel restaurant, exceptional service from Josée.  Thank you for the amazing service provided to my friends. They all were thrilled to be at your restaurant. LOVED THE FOOD  Overall my service and meal experience was very good. Kind staff that are always willing to help, food was tasty, hot and well presented. Highly recommend this restaurant, you will not be disappointed.  The staff were absolutely fantastic, and the food was even better!
The butter chicken is made from scratch, and is one of the best I have tasted. 
Well done!!!  The food, and service were top notch to say the least. The server went above and beyond to make sure our group was well taken care of to make the evening fun, and im still thinking about the butter chicken 3 days later it was so good! I can't wait to go back!  Had a wonderful evening   Butter chicken was incredible.  Service was pleasant and quick.   Food was hot and top notch  This experience was one that will be difficult to rate. Some elements were very disappointing, but others were exceptional.

A big part of the reason we picked this place was the prevalence of gluten-free options on the menu, including pizza (""gluten-free available"" prominently noted in the menu). We ordered that, along with some other dishes, and all seemed fine until a few minutes later when we were told they're out of gluten-free pizza dough. Many places advertise gluten-free but are perpetually out of stock or have things that are very stale, so this isn't that uncommon, but at the end of a long trip it just gets so frustrating to be endlessly disappointed. If you're going to prominently promote the option, keep it in stock and in the rare occasions where it's out make sure that FOH staff know that so they can inform customers before making decisions and ordering. This was a major fail on the part of the kitchen. We decided to suffer the consequence and just order the regular pizza, but there was some confusion about what had ordered and the pizza came out a while after the other orders. 

That's the negative.

The positive is that the FOH staff went WAY above and beyond to try and make it up to us. I've never seen staff work that hard to try and rectify a situation and they were absolutely fantastic. Both the server and the supervisor apologized multiple times for the situation, comped some things, checked how we were doing multiple times, and made it very clear that they were not happy have to disappoint us. I'll say again that they were completely amazing.

So, would I recommend this place? Yes. However, if you're looking for gluten-free options, it's probably best to get confirmation of what they have available before ordering. The FOH staff are great, but it seems that the kitchen doesn't pay too much attention to inventory.

The waiter advised us that if my guest wanted “fresh” pasta..it would cost $4.00 more. ( fresh..whatever that means) *However the menu clearly states $4.00 charge applies fir gluten free requests.
My bill came to 159 and change which I paid in cash. ..giving him $200.00
There was a large table directly behind me that had just come in
As we stood to leave the waiter rushed over to me and said no.no…you  haven’t given me enough money.You owe $250.  I clearly saw the first bill that had arrived at 159….now he produces a bill for $250. We looked at the second bill which had added an $89.00 bottle of wine. He insisted this was my bill. Clearly there were now 2 bills ( 1 newly made up) and because my guest dies not drink and we had only been there 1 hr 10 min..the wine was not mine. He left..returned..left then we went over to the cash register ourselves to dispute the charge. There was a fumbling around and sheepish quay excuse. It was embarrassing.

Experience  in terms of food quality from two years ago was much better.               Not sure what has happened.  Better options available in the city for the price to get true Italian experience.  Booking was not good- showed times we’re not available- restaurant was empty.

Food was bad- would not recommend  My experiences at Scaddabush have gotten way better, one of my top restaurants now  Great dinner and wonderful server, we had a great night!  The cheesecake is the best over ever had!!  The food is excellent. Hopefully the variety of cocktails will return to normal after the LCBO strike is over. There were a lot of screaming toddlers running around that kind of spoiled the ambience. Go a little later in the evenings to avoid young families.  Scaddabush Sherway service was outstanding. The server and the manager were both fantastic. The food was equally enjoyable. Great value for money. Thank you for a great dinner experience.  Great restaurant! Casual and comfortable vibe! Music piping through as well as TV's for sports in the restaurant. The food, ambience, service, prices etc are spot on. We had a wonderful server Stephanie, on this particular visit!

Always order the dry ribs.
Food well prepared and tasty.  I was very disappointed with the avocado and bacon Cobb salad. The description didn’t mention that there were tomatoes and a tomato relish type topping. It said it had a tomato and ranch dressing. My business guest had some challenges reading English and the description was misleading.  Our server was fantastic.
The reason for the lower rating was due to the fact that we stood at the hostess station for a long time and when I asked a server if we were at the right spot she just said “ya” over her shoulder and we continued to be ignored.
I don’t think the entry set up at Fairview mall is good.   Definitely not welcoming. Read more Good food, pleasant service. A little pricey for the quality. Restrooms needed attention and supplies.  Nice selection of items on the menu.

But, the pizza was really good.  Our server was warm and attentive. We shared a naked mozzarella ball, polenta fries and a cauliflower pizza. We had to ask to verify if the crust was cauliflower because it was SO GOOD! My only criticism is that I think the mozzarella balls may have suffered from a bit of shrink-flation.

They also offer a full sake selection, complete with detailed flavor descriptions.

Highly recommend this spot for a relaxed and enjoyable evening, whether for a date or a gathering with friends.

I think having a yakitori type place (charcoal grilled meat skewers) in York Region is pretty unique, at least I don't know of any others, perhaps there are better ones downtown, but we wouldn't know.
The clientele btw were all cool young people who probably loved its location near Main St. Unionville as an alternative to the 'older'  or 'seniors' places if you know what I mean, definitely we don't want to be hanging out with those retirees with too much botox, here you can enjoy company with youngsters with too much botox instead.
I don't think given food costs today it was overpriced at all, a seared foie gras sandwich for ex. was only 19 dollars and the flavor was exceptional.
We can't wait to go back!  Even the Sapporo draft was really fresh.

Recommend to try the margaritas grande, really huge and they give to you a Sombrero, so great pics.  Disapointed for the 1st time. Chips to take home was hard. Drinks were sour and I mean sour.

Our group sat in the patio area, which was very nice, especially where it was partially covered, so we didn’t have to worry about potential rain. It was very strange when we had roughly 4 or 5 various servers come by before we ordered asking us how are things going ,actually interrupting our flow of our conversation which we had.
Once we ordered, we barely saw a server. In fact, I had to flag one down just to provide us a proper knife for the steaks that we had ordered and also asking for ground pepper, as there was no salt and pepper on the table. ￼
Our sirloin steaks were OK not properly seasoned .￼
The grilled shrimp were good.
My friend’s younger daughter could not even get extra water because nobody came by to ask any one of us about that or even for that matter how was our meal.
At that point, we were essentially isolated unless we tried to flag someone down.￼

They brought out our apps and dinner at same time
And the manager served us . How ???  We received our bread after we received our entrees and that was after we had to ask for it.  The porterhouse steak was a little tough.  We have dined here before and also at the Pickering location a couple of times and things were great, so I guess our expectations were not what we had been used to.  Service was great.  Food was good.  Steak was perfectly cooked.  Wine selection is limited for a steak house.  Rash was an amazing server. So personable and such a delight. The food was really good, and came in a very timely fashion. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience  The food was excellent, mains, appetizers everything. Decent selection of wines at all price levels. Overall value for the money was very good. Overall ambience and lighting were so-so, but I imagine this will improve as the property matures. Would definitely eat here again. Recommended.  The food was good, ordered prime rib cooked perfect but did not have horseradish to go with it, asked waiter and he said they don’t stock it 🤦🏻‍♂️  It was an okay experience. The restaurant itself is missing the coziness of a steakhouse. Some of the tables felt like they were set up from a banquet hall. Noted things like the table clothes not being pressed and with crease marks and tables close together (we had a very loud duo of men essentially yelling at each other the entire time next to us) didn't give the intimacy that a traditional steakhouse has. The menu was okay, the appetizers were a bit lacking in selection for someone who doesn't eat seafood. Service started out fine but as the restaurant filled up, it became a bit difficult to flag down our server (also a few needy tables didn't help). 

I had the caesar salad and my husband had the oysters to start. The caesar was okay, but lacking in acidity. We shared the porterhouse and whipped potatoes and green beans. I think the steak could have used a bit more seasoning, and a hit of pepper overall for the food (we weren't offered fresh pepper). I had the chocolate cake and my husband had the tiramisu. I felt the dessert portions were huge and couldn't finish the cake. Overall, the meal just wasn't memorable, especially for a birthday celebration. Read more Dined here 2 nights in a row. The staff are friendly and the service was overall good. Those in our party who had steaks loved them. The beef carpaccio was great, my partner had the sea bass with black linguine and it was phenomenal!Most of the dishes were great, but the cauliflower steak was pretty awful. It wasn’t cooked all the way through and not seasoned at all. We also found it curious that the staff didn’t seem to know how to charge meals to our rooms which is fairly standard practice for resort hotels.

Food, ambience and the service we had with the beautiful server (we didnt get her name), she wad awesome. Our couple friends who treated us for that dinner were first time diners of Draco and they were amazed. Thank you Draco.

The only thing is that we waited about 10-15 min before getting the menu  Went for Father’s Day brunch.  Our first time there and it was a fantastic experience.  Easy parking, great atmosphere and decor.  Food was delicious and the service was excellent.  Will definitely be back!  It's one of the best hidden spots.  Great place to host business meetings or just enjoying a quiet lunch/dinner by yourself or with friends.  Good value for what you pay for.  The food was great but our server wasn’t the nicest. When we approached her, she told us to give her second in a rude manner. We assumed she was busy as she came back a bit later to seat us. Throughout the time there, she wasn’t inviting at all and very standoffish. For the price of food we pay, we would have assumed that the service would’ve been better. The 5 and 4 start restaurants we visit (as we often review them and try new spots in Toronto and Markham) I would not have thought that we would have received poor service. Again, food was great but I assume the server was maybe having a bad day prior. Word of mouth is very real and the impression given, even though the food was great, I wouldn’t recommend just because of the server. Read more Our server was amazing, and everyone was lovely. Can’t wait for the patio to open.  The food and service was excellent.  Would definitely recommend and come back again!  Had a good working lunch break.

There were 4 of us and we did the Gyu-Kaku Feast, let me say it was A LOT of food for 4 people, but worth the value and they let you take the leftovers home. It felt like AYCE and like other BBQ grill spots you cook your own meat and veggies.

The server was very well spoken, friendly, accommodating and had also provided us with instructions on how long to cook the meat and the vegetables (which is really great for those who don’t know how to grill the food). She had also offered alternatives some of the sets of food, for example, instead of 2 spicy tofu soups we could have 3 miso soups and 1 spicy tofu soup, as some people don’t like spicy tofu.

Mondays are happy hour where cocktails are $11 so we had the Mango Tango cocktail which was really good (if you love juice, sugar and lychee).

It was my birthday and they had asked if they wanted us to have the staff perform a birthday greeting, I’ve personally never been asked this and really appreciated that we can have a silent birthday. I got free ice cream with a candle which was really nice.

I was told there were only 15 people who made reservations for the first seating at 11:00 a.m. and 70 people were expected for the 1:30 p.m. seating.  There was a turkey and a huge hip of beef at the carving station.  The turkey, despite the gravy, was dry.  I was one of the 15 people who came for the 11:00 a.m. seating.

There was certainly a great & varied selection of foods although not many cooked vegetables. 
We only noticed one vegetable side dish: heritage carrots. We were at the 1:30 seating so maybe there was more variety earlier. 
The salads that I tried were all excellent, esp. the beet salad, but I had to ask where the salads were. We would probably never have found The Salad Room on our own & I think others had the same problem.
The whole lobsters were an unexpected, but very enjoyable treat & we even received 3 for both of us! 😁 Read more Easter brunch was lovely, we like to try somewhere new when we do go for brunch and this place didn’t disappoint!

The service was terrible and when they asked us to leave because our 2 hour was approaching they brought our bill out and had automatically added 18% gratuity to the bill.  the whole time we were there we felt rushed and didn’t get to enjoy our meal.   For example our appetizer was half done and they had started to take plates away and clearing the appetizer dish.  Very disappointed with the service, I will not go back to this location.  This is definitely how a restaurant should operate and treat the people that go out to eat and pay for them to be operating and running their business. Read more This is my second time at this restaurant. The food was very tasty and I ordered the same dish - Mariscada. There was lots of seafood and pretty fresh. We ordered some appetizers to share, and the seafood platter was good, but the quantity was a little less. The nachos were a little dry. The main course had good quantity. The first time, I was there for a girls' night out on a week night, so it was quieter. On Saturday night, they had live music, but the music was very loud, and then the guests were also loud. So, we could hardly hear each other talking. This is a good restaurant overall, and we will definitely come back if we are around the area.

Well as soon as we walked in the hostess told us we have 1 hour at our table because they want to keep the tables open for other customers.  So right there we were turned off. I guess our money is only good for 1 hour there..
Second food isn't good.

Sushi Gin offers diners an authentic world class omakase sushi experience. We are focused on crafting the perfect sushi, using the best seasonal fish and ingredients as well as premium rice. Our use of techniques unique to Edomae sushi, including aging, marinating, or curing in salt or kombu, create more complex flavour profiles and elevates the omakase experience.

At Sushi Gin, we are committed to continuously improving our craft, striving for perfection, and seeking to improve with every piece of sushi.","Read more Only 3 people to have 8:00 dinner.  35 minutes to finish the whole dinner from appetizer to dessert, in which 15 minutes to finish 10 pieces sushi!

I ordered premium sake paring $45.  My past experience was fully filled up the glasses.  In here, only 75% filled up.

The dessert is a small piece of cake, same as the other Omakesa.  However, the chef put it on my sushi plate, just beside the ginger!! Read more The food was the best omakase I have had in Toronto. I have had many omakase in uptown Toronto and in Hong Kong, the food at Sushi Gin was up there with the good ones I had in Hong Kong. They had fish I haven’t seen other restaurants serve in Toronto and was very impressed with the freshness. Highly recommend.  Martin was our chef, picked a delicious menu and knew an extensive amount of information on omakase and Japan as a whole. The servers were polite and super friendly. It really ruins cheap sushi for you  Went here for my 3 year anniversary with my bf it was a perfect experience 🩷 definitely worth the price.  I came here for my husband's birthday and we really enjoyed our time here. They brought out very exclusive ingredients like fugu, Japanese scallops + uni, but our favorite has been the sake ice cream. Staff was very attentive and kept on their toes to anticipate every need. It's truly a great experience overall.  Not the first time dining here at Sushi Gin, and as always, the food and service were impeccable. Highly recommended.  The experience overall was great! The servers and chefs did really well in catering to our needs. The food was really fresh, they used seasoned rice for the nigiri, and the chefs asked whether you want wasabi or not.  Really had a fund experience from start to finish. Staff and chef was very friendly and accommodating. 
The food was delicious and lots of flavours.
I would go back and try other items and offerings.  Went there with my husband and two children for dinner, not knowing that they only have Omakase for dinner,  no other menu.  Me not wanting my kids to eat raw fish, the manager was nice enough to prepare for us tempura udon and terriyaki chicken rice.  Kids enjoyed both dishes.

The sushi was amazing, varieties that we don't usually get at other sushi places.

Portion wise, it was enough for me, but not for my husband, unless you order some of the add-ons, which was extraordinarily delicious but expensive.

Seating-wise, I was a little surprised that they only have counter-seats, slightly awkward facing other guests, but eventually got used to it.

Overall it was a good dinner experience. Read more Amongst most of the omakase sushi restaurants in Toronto, Sushi Gin will be in the top 3.

The service was impeccable so that was no problem. Portion sizes were generous especially the veal parm sandwich, half of which I took home. Prices were consistent with a popular priced restaurant. Very noisy but not unexpected.  The server was swamped and pleasant nonetheless. The food came quickly as expected. No issues to report.  Very consistent restaurant! Good is always fresh!!  Always a great experience eating at East Mario North York  We all loved robot delivering food. Such fun! Kids meals were very good. Enjoyed chicken and veal Parmesan. Waitress was very attentive and brought kids meals first. Always a plus!  Booked a reservation. Arrived on time, but  stood waiting at the door for a server to greet us for over 10 mins. There were lots of staff wandering, just nobody greeting guests. Finally flagged someone down, and it took another 5 mins for them to seat us. Gave us a bit of a hard time about getting kids menus. I guess they didn’t believe the kids were under 10. Table service was slow; however it was a Friday evening. Overall, not one of our better East Sides experiences.

Our drinks took forever,  our food was cold  A wonderful place for any time and especially to celebrate an 85 year old.

I was there for a date and Perry was amazing with his hospitality. Great sense of humour and friendly. Felt like we have known him for years. Appreciate what he did.  Always a good time at Scarborough Moxies. They staff treat you like an old friend, while still being very professional & efficient. The Spicy Shrimp tacos are amazing. Prices are higher, but they’re higher everywhere.  Great service, great tasting food, friendly staff and excellent customer service  The service was slow. The server never came back once we got our food to ask how it was and we were unable to get a drink refill as they never came back until we were done our food.

At the end of the meal, as I was taking my last bite, the manager was walking over to take away our plates and then promptly provided us with the bill and machine to pay. Felt rushed to get out.

Everything in between those two points was fantastic. Service during dinner was positive. Food arrived as ordered and at an expected pace based on the restaurant.

The dessert was delicious & had an impressive presentation.  We decided to give this restaurant a try as it was listed in the Michelin guide. The food was quite flavourful the exception of the Ghati Masala Prawns (simply breaded deep fried prawns).

They did not have any tea, coffee or hot drinks to be enjoyed with dessert.

We were asked “are you waiting for something?” multiple times during the meal, once while we were waiting for our main, the next time we were waiting for a box and the final time we were waiting for someone to take our dessert order.

Everything else was 👌  Steak was tough.  I did not want the fries that came with entre and asked if I could get mushrooms instead.  He was going to look into to see if they would do it for him.  He did eventually come back with this tiny little tray and I swear it was less than 5 mushrooms in total.  It was ridiculously salty compared to the mushrooms that came originally with my steak.  I could only assume that the kitchen staff did not take kindly to my asking for extra mushrooms instead of the fires and overdid it with the salt.  So, did not eat the fries and do not eat the mushrooms.  Was it worth $42 for a piece of meat..... ah... no Read more The service provided by Glenn was excellent.
The food was great including the rigatoni colognes.  Great menu selection and Kerri was great at making us feel at home.  We were served by Bells. She was very good. Caring, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu.

Overall good service despite restaurant being very busy  Good food and service. A very nice evening out on their patio  Our server Gabrielle was on point.  He was very attentive and cared. He wanted to make sure our dining experienced was enjoyed.
Thank you for caring.  Our server was great! She was very kind and friendly. Food tasted wonderful overall and great experience.  We have been several times to restaurant over past few weeks. I have had the same entrée. The serving size was way smaller and not of the same quality as before.  The pasta serving size was smaller and lacked sauce, it was very dry and oily. When i addressed it with the front door greeter who dropped off our meals, I was told that all portions and ingredients are weighted so it has to be the same. 
Quite disappointing that there was no care or concern. Our waitress was busy delivering food to members of management from other stores when we asked for her. So we finished our meal.
I was celebrating my friends birthday. When i visited before with relative for birthday they offered a complementary dessert.

Said selection was poor on menu and didn’t have the first 2 things we ordered. Had to ask for more drinks. It was happy hour but only 3 other tables so not busy.  The three of us friends get together a few times in the year and we always meet for dinner. We chose Pickle Barrel since I know it has a large and diverse menu, and the food is consistently good  .
We also typically spend at least 3 hours, which did not seem to present any issue for our server, Marcello. He was extremely good   - attentive but not hovering, forward thinking, considerate and accommodating, as well as charming and personable.
My one friend had the nachos, and myself and my other friend had the beet and goat cheese salad. I had the shrimp extra, and she had the chicken. 
The food arrived within a short time, and it was well prepared, extremely fresh and delicious.

The ribs were delicious, moist and portions were very filling and reasonable  Only complaint was a long wait between order taken and service of the food. The meals were both excellent as was the server's attention.  Server is very nice and polite but seems not enough servers  Food  was good. The worst service ever. The server vanished after taking the order. Had to find other servers to get refile and order dessert. He showed up again when it was time to pay.  It wasn't the same as it used to be. Some of the staff were confused about the way to give their service. It felt like they were rushing up to welcome you out of the restaurant.  Before the pandemic, it felt more calm.  Now, the servers were only rashing up to do their tasks, get the bill and the tip!  It started with an appetizer that was dumped on the table causing the sauce to fly off the plate on to one of us. We specified a dairy allergy but got a burger that caused a reaction. Another asked for a Canadian burger with no cheese or tomato. Guess what? We got a burger with cheese and tomato. I had salad with chicken. My chicken was cold and undercooked- pink centre!! Our server was great but the kitchen paid little attention. It was busy as it was Father’s Day but that’s no excuse.

Food quality and taste seems to have gone down since the last time I was there.

We had a dog in a stroller with us which is one reason we booked the patio. 
We asked our greeter if they would still seat us. She said ahh it’ll storm soon.

She treats you as she would want to be treated if she was in your chair. A+++ for excellent service when Tanisha is taking care of your table.

The food, on the other hand, is not always so top notch. Two out of three times, the food is significantly over cooked, leaving you waiting for a second plate, which may or may not also be over cooked. When it’s cooked to perfection, it tastes to perfection too. Good value for the money spent, and a really enjoyable meal overall. Read more Food quality is good, price is reasonable our server was amazing  The server repeated my request and then brought what he neglected to mention was not possible (ie, my request). He then apologized and offered 20% off but my poor assessment is due to his repeating the request and then doing the opposite  Great option for a big group - we brought 8 adults with 4 children and were very well accommodated. Our server Anna was excellent, attentive and great with the kids.  Whenever we go to Kelsey’s, we always hope to sit in Tanisha’s section. She is so friendly and attentive; she provides excellent service, with a smile and a personal touch. Great service in restaurants are not easy to find these days, but Tanisha never disappoints! The food was pretty great overall, and we will definitely keep coming back.  It had been a while (4 years) since we last dined at this Kelseys.  We used to dine here at least 3 times a month.
We did find that at some point, the service was not as good and the food was fair rather than great.
We were celebrating my birthday on the 22nd of April and decided to try Kelseys once again.
We were impressed with our server Sam.  We ordered the nachos for starter, as we had always enjoyed the nachos previously.  When we got our order, it was not as we remembered.  The nachos were burnt, the cheese was almost non existant, so we let Sam know about it and he replaced it with a fresh order.  We were not charged for the starter.
The entrees we ordered were good, not great, but good.  We had fajitas, fish and chips and a salad and dessert.
Even though Sam, our server, knew it was my birthday, I was not offered a birthday dessert.  I would have declined it anyway, but the offer would have been nice.
I don't know that we will never come back, but it will probably be a while until we do, and that is unfortunate.
Again, not saying we will never return, but it may be a while.

Excellent service, food was good for the price and didn’t have to wait to long.  Service was excellent and food was fast to come out. Great for a quick lunch with co-workers.  Bad bad food. Worst service ever. The servers are hardly interested in working so they should just quit I believe rather than treating customers the way they do. I left my meal mid way and went to Kelsey's next door eventually..  My husband and I went to Monrana's for my birthday. My fijata was great, my husband's pork ribs were good.
I received my birthday desert, but looking at tge bill when we gor home I noticed that I did not receive my 10% birthday discount, which was somewhat dissapointing.  Tacos were a bit cool…could have been warmer/hotter…
Service was EXCEPTIONAL  Une expérience correcte.  Nourriture de chaîne quand t’es pressé!  Food was good, their menu was easy to understand and the service was excellent.",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/69312001.webp

My friends and I visited here for a birthday dinner. Restaurant was quite quiet at this time. Server took a while to come see us after being seated, when he did come, we were ready to order apps, drinks and entrees. We had to ask 3 times for napkins and only got them at the end of the meal. Water was asked twice and we did not get them, 6/7 glasses were empty. Server did not check in on us and when he did, he disappeared so quickly. We stayed for a bit and asked for takeout boxes as we did not want to stay longer and skipped the birthday dessert.

My friend wanted to speak to someone regarding service but no one was at the host stand and the server left as soon as the last person paid their bill.

My friend’s poutine was cold and only got colder as we were not checked on, asked them to remove and don’t bother remaking it as we were already thinking of wrapping up. The sweet potato fries were cold for another guest. Read more It was a great experience but I didn’t get my 100 points through open table as It was mentioned when I booked. Can you pls update my account ?  Usually good, but on Canada Day, service was lacking. 20 min after being seated, we finally waved down an employee to take our drink order. 1 hr in our food came out lukewarm, cheese on spinach dip wasn’t even melted.. guessing they were short staffed but not a good experience  Honestly the food was a bit blah but the service was great! The atmosphere was fun and energetic.  No complaints with the food, they have good portion and price is reasonable.  Our server was excellent, professional and friendly!  Excellent service, we will definitely be back!!!  The food was delicious and the service excellent!!  I have gone many times to Kelseys Origonal at this location and the service, food and environment have been amazing. It's 100% recommended!.  Terrible- food was not good had to wait way too long for our appetizer and then main course arrived almost at the same time. Food was not great. Ordered the steak sandwich barely any steak - all bacon.  Caesar salad wilted- just not a good experience.  Always a good time at Kelsey’s!!

Everyone enjoyed the food and the fun of the bread bar. Service was warm, friendly and efficient. We were there early so it was not busy so we felt very well taken care of.

The moment we walked in, the staff greeted us warmly, setting the tone for an enjoyable evening. The service was attentive without being intrusive, and our server was knowledgeable and eager to make recommendations.

The food at Pacini truly shines. Every dish is packed with flavour and presented beautifully, from the first bite of freshly baked bread to the last spoonful of dessert. The pasta is perfected with just enough sauce, while the grilled steak was flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Each plate feels like it has a unique, authentic touch, making the entire meal feel special.

Pacini offers a feast for the taste buds and an inviting and relaxed atmosphere. Whether you’re looking for a cozy dinner for two or a family gathering, this place is ideal. Overall, Pacini exceeded expectations with its delicious food and outstanding service. I highly recommend it! Read more Sadly the two meals we ordered from the menu were no longer available. At least they have a good selection so we found other great meals to enjoy.  
I normally give a higher rating but we  sat behind the reception desk and the staff would gather there and be loud so it did disturb our conversation. In addition, the two meals we were not able to eat were charged and we had to correct our bill.  I will return to eat but this was not my favorite night out at Pacini. Read more Very good food and location.
They need to be a little bit more attentive and fast with table approaches and services.  We visited this place for the first time and were blown away by the quality of the food and the wonderful service by every person there.
Our server Natalie was very sweet and attentive.
Managers, Nathan and Bonny went above and beyond making our anniversary dinner a wonderful experience.

And food was basically cold.  We had requested a high top and were seated at a booth surrounded by yelling children. When only half the meals finally arrived, our waitress came over to ask how everything was despite nobody eating yet (as we were still waiting on two meals) and that was the last we saw her until we finally got her attention and asked for the bill. Nobody came to ask how the food was which was problematic as my crispy fish tacos were missing 90% of their toppings. 

My tacos were supposed to include jack cheese, tomatillo salsa, cilantro, and ancho poblano crema as I had asked for no pico de gallo, mole, and pickle slaw. 

My tacos came out with nothing more than shredded lettuce and some sauce. Lettuce is not even included in the toppings. I would have spoken up had my server returned, but she never did. 

The toppings that came with the fajitas were beyond sad. The topping bowl is already small as is and it looked like it was filled to 3/4 at best. This was a very disappointing experience at a place my family once loved. Read more We had a great time at Lone Star! Food was good, drinks were good too! I feel it’s a little pricy especially for a family. My friend had only chicken fingers, fries and water and her bill was $22. 

Our waitress seemed new brought stuff okay but forgot to ask about one of the drinks. Would bring a glass of water instead of a pitcher we had asked for. She was very busy so I take it into account. But she didn’t take the plates away until after we had paid so there was almost no room to pay - 7 ladies- all using the machine. She did get all the orders right though! 

My calamari was over cooked but the wings were delicious, others had the taco salad which they loved!
As I said the food was good!

We always come back here regardless! It’s a good time, good food and drinks! Read more Service was very slow, queso dip wasn’t hot and the Lone Star famous tortilla shells were very small. Not a great experience, but we have history with this location and been long time customers, so we’ll try one more time and hopefully have a better experience.  Had such a good time for my birthday. Only fault was the ac wasn’t working so it was very hot for most of the dinner. But it got fixed near the end so started to cool off at the end of our meal. 

Our server was absolutely amazing. Read more We had lunch there on July 1st. My daughter and I ordered the boneless top sirloin steak but both steak, while medium well and medium rare, both were very chewy and salty. My husband ordered crispy shrimp taco and he love them. The calamari appetizer was also delicious!  So while we were happy with everything else, we can not say the same with the steaks.  A/C was not working so it was uncomfortable during our visit.
Staff was not overly helpful, we felt rushed.  Our server, Sizzler, was absolutely amazing!  She was accurate with the orders and was on top of all of our needs and wants. We had a family party of 11 celebrating 4 birthdays and 3 fathers on Father’s Day. Thank you Lone Star and Sizzler!!  kids meals - appearance -poor - temperature of meat was just off cold - sent back and it was no warmer  Overall good experience.  Booked a reservation for a birthday and indicated this on the reservation.  Mentioned it was my daughter’s birthday to one of our servers and she was more interested in telling us to come back on Wednesday for the wing special.  Nothing was done or offered for her birthday.  A bit disappointed.  Most places will offer a dessert and sing happy birthday. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/32129385.webp

Bar drinks excellent as well.  One minor area for improvement- A restaurant at this level should have cloth napkins, not paper.  Very good environment delicious food. Excellent service highly recommended. ￼  The food and service was great however, I was very upset at the fact that I could not find parking on the property (which is shared with a hotel).  I spent at least 15 minutes going around the entire property trying to find a parking spot and I ended up parking a block away!  I mentioned this to front staff and all they said was “sorry”.    Not good enough in my opinion. Very disappointed. Read more Great meal as always, food was good, service was good.  Service was excellent, food was great.

The restaurant was not very busy at the time we were there.  Everything was great!!! My only suggestion would be to fix the door that goes out to the patio. We were sitting at the booth ride beside the door, and it slammed really loud every time someone went in/out!  I went into the restaurant with my two friends, keep in mind we are 3 pre teen girls going out by ourselves for the first time. The food was good, the setting was also good. When the bill came I had no issue with it. However,  we were charged with gratuity (no big deal) but the waiter had told us that it's only for the back of the house workers, so me being polite, I left an 18% tip for good service. I was later informed by my parents that gratuity is also meant for the waiter. What a way to scam some teens into getting yourself a tip. But other than that, the food was great. Over all I would not recommend to a friend, because all my friends are my age and I would not appreciate if they got scammed too. Read more Our server was absolutely fantastic!! Very sweet person!!  Went for lunch on the patio to celebrate a birthday and received a complimentary cookie topped with ice cream.  Our server provided horrible service, food took too long to come and when it did come the wrong food was brought out twice.

I definitely would drive back there and THANK YOU for making our celebration even better!!  Felt the experience was okay. Good for families. Pretty crowded on a Saturday for dinner but we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving.  Went on a busy Sat night. They sat us with our Open Table reservation right away. Our waitress was great, run off her feet though! We both had the Gnocchi Fritti starter, Lightly breaded potato gnocchi fried and it was a bit hard & crunchy. Other than that, bread and soup were delicious.  Always have a great experience at this location! Good food and pleasant staff!  We reserved via open table and when we arrived there was no reservation.  Luckily we were still seated but definitely as an after thought.  Waiter was good when he was present but he wasn’t present much.  Bread took 30 minutes to get to table,  they ran out of all three soups.  And it took 40 minutes from when I finished eating until dessert and bill,  most was spent waiting for service Read more We had booked a reservation for my daughters 11th birthday dinner consisting of only 4 people.  When we arrived, the restaurant was fairly empty and quite a few staff were running around in a disorganized manner.  we waited an exorbitant amount of time to be seated.  When we were finally seated, it took the hostess about 20 minutes to bring us menus for the children which I had to ask for twice.   From the moment that we stepped in the door, the service was horrible.. We had to ask for everything at least twice and it took us probably one hour to receive our food from the time of ordering.  My daughter and her friend were brought their meals probably a good 45 minutes after the rest of the table had gotten theirs.  Our server was short, snippy and made us feel like we were burdening her every time we would ask for anything ( our requests only really consisted of ordering our meals straight off the menu). I worked in service for many years and understand that everyone is entitled to having an off day.. That being said, I dont think that I have ever had a worse experience in my life! At the end of the meal when I had asked for take out containers and the bill probably 3x, I requested to speak with the manager on duty.. The manager was incredibly kind, apologetic and extended the gesture to make up for our horrible experience. 
I am not quite sure if this was just an off night but any other time I have come to this location I have had a great experience. Read more Horrible experience. The AC was broken and we were not even told that before being seated. Inly after being seated and waited 48 mins just for drinks did we ask for them to ajust the temp as it was super hot. Only to be told ""it's been broken all summer"" then asked for the manager to then be told ""he's in india"" the washrooms were nasty not cleaned. The floors were dirty and sticky. The tables were not cleaned after guest left dirty dishes left until they needed it for the next guest. It was overall a disaster of a visit. There is no reason we should have had to wait so long for just drinks. We also had to ask for our bread. We ordered a salad with no bacon. Said no bacon by 3 of us. Only to be brought out a salad with bacon. The girl went back got another Only for this one to ha e the bacon at the bottom. 3rd try she came out with the salad and said "" I personally made this so it shouldn't have bacon"" I mean if you personally made it then you should be saying it definitely doesn't have bacon.

Food was excellent. Service was terrific as well.  Calamari wasn’t crispy, linguine vongole was off, clams were not fresh or the white wine was not the right flavour. They tried to mask it with the bits on top but I couldn’t stomach it. Staff should know if client hasn’t really touched the dish or doesn’t want to pack any of it that should be a sign the meal wasn’t good.  Food never disappoints although eggplant parmigiana was on the oilier side. Very nice staff although service was unusually slow for a mid/week evening. Better training of new staff highly recommend.

My husband had pizza and I had the octopus. Both were delicious as was the focaccia starter.. Highly recommended!  To be fair the restaurant was busy when we arrived.  That said when entrees average $30.00 plus, I don’t think it is unreasonable to expect a reasonable level of service.  We had to ask for bread three times to go with our appetizers.  It arrived long after the appetizer were finished.  Our drinks sat empty for while, we had to flag down other waiters to order.

There were 4 tables of influencers using harsh spotlights. It was quite bothersome. No one asked them to stop and respect other patrons. We decided to leave rather than stay fpr supper after our drings. The waiters came around every 4-6 minutes, it was intense.  this is a great new additional to the financial area in Toronto. Service was great and menu was creative.  When we were seated, no one came to our table for over 10 minutes.. Which could have been understandable if it were busy, but there were only 3 other tables in the restaurant. Our server didnt seem to know much about the cocktail or food menu. The tacos were terrible. We ordered them as part of the tuesday deal, and that was a big mistake. the flour taco shell was rubbery and hard, and there was almost no filling inside.

Dessert beer brownie was too sweet:(  ￼  Lots of plant based options keeps us coming back. Thanks!  I went here with the guys afterwork. The service was quick and the brisket burger was excellent. I found the overall experience great and would return.  they have a wonderful service and food. Knowledgeable staff",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/50069092.webp
