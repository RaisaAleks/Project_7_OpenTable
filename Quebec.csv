Agree with the customer who said they have a fruit fly problem that is true.  This restaurant is an absolute gem.  My husband and I sat in the window seat (very cozy).  The service was excellent and the food delicious.  Not so good experience. We coming from TO.
The table they gave us there’s lots of food flies, I’m talking about at least 10-20 keep flying around. Everyone immediately doesn’t want to eat there. Also there’s no ac as well. It’s very warm and stuffy inside. At the end we leave. It’s a Sat night and we need to google around and search what to eat with a group of 7 people. Luckily we found Ryu Japanese and it’s very good. Read more Fast service, staff is very attentif and makes sure the customers are ok, had a great time :)  Delicious food as always. The menu change is a bit confusing, but otherwise terrific service and great quality fish.  While the food was decent, not sure I would eat here again any time soon.

The quality and price match up decently well but there were a lot of flies and I constantly found myself having to swat em away while trying to enjoy my food.

Worth mentioning I appreciated the variety of menu options and presentation of food.

Overall not bad and will likely try it once more before adding to my ""Do not eat"" list. Read more Nice place to go with friends. Good variety of foods  We wanted a light supper before our concert, so ordered some maki to start and then a rice and a noodle dish to share, although everything arrived together.  The maki  - ebi chizu maki, a fried maki with shrimp tempura tartare - sounded wonderful but was actually quite greasy and bland.  The tofu and shiitake rice bowl - tofu shiitake don - was delicious, subtly flavoured and not too heavy.  The noodle dish - ebi tempura soba, or shrimp and vegetable tempura with noodles - was okay, but again rather bland, especially the noodles which had no sauce or flavouring at all.  A nice, well located spot but I’m not sure we’ll rush to return. Read more The edamame was not fully cooked and looked nothing like the picture in the menu.

J’ai adoré mon expérience! C’est à refaire sans faute 😇  The incredibly beautiful establishment, the waitresses were very nice and attentive. For the first time, I tasted chocolate spicy cake and it was the most delicious dessert I tasted in Canada, it was not too sweet with a combination of different textures of cream and biscuit, the flavors were revealed gradually, and the spicy cake warmed the soul.  Perfect place to go on a date. Octopus carpaccio is delicious & the new cocktail menu is on point  Je suis une cliente régulière du resto. J’allais souvent sur la rue Wellington. C’est ma deuxième fois dans le vieux Montréal. Je dois dire que c’est la première fois que je ne donne pas 5 étoiles. La nourriture était comme d’habitude excellente mais elle nous a été servie avant nos cocktails et aussi on aurait dit que le restaurant voulait que nous mangions rapidement. Je m’ennuie un peu du restaurant plus simple et convivial de la rue Wellington. Je vais quand même retourner, j’adore la cuisine mais avec le prix du stationnement et le service un peu plus huppé, mois souvent qu’avant. Read more Fantastic experience! The service was spectacular and friendly. The food was  incredibly tasty - we had the griots (huge), the bao (yummy), plantain burger (other worldly) and riz djon djon (authentic). The music was lively and most patrons danced their way out the door! A wonderful experience.  Un excellent service, attentionné et bienveillant. Très sympathique. Certains plats sont bien préparés, savoureux et équilibrés. En revanche des fautes de goût majeures sur d’autres plats qui deviennent peu mangeables à l’image de ce carpaccio de bœuf qui trempe dans une soupe de citron ou ces beignes soit disant au coco mais qui ne goûtent que le sucre et qui sont très secs malgré la demande d’ajout de crème.  Quant à la musique, sans intérêt, mais heureusement pas trop bruyante et permettant de parler aisément. Read more Fun and delicious menu. Our party of 7 all enjoyed it very much!  Great experience. The plantain burger was one of the best burgers I’ve had in my life. The live jazz on Thursday’s is such a treat as well. Wait staff was great and attentive.

Food portions were generous and requests to have items on the side or removed were respected. Burger was delicious and fries were crisp.The non alcoholic drinks (cool dragon) were refreshing and pretty on a very warm fall day.

Service was excellent. Read more It seems like only one waiter was working.  Took a while for everything to come to the table.  Had to wait for condiments which came out after we finished the meal.  No check in during the meal.  Empty dishes were not cleared up during the meal.  Mix up of the bill. Food was good - soup portion could have been a bit larger.  Staff were pleasant. Food was ok. Too much pepper on the veal special no one was able to eat that dish. Place seemed cleaned however mice were seen on the floor of the dinning room. Would not return.  Nice setting and super friendly service. Food was just as expected from a hotel restaurant, not outstanding but also not disappointing. Perfect for a rainy night when you don’t feel like venturing out for dinner.  We went for the weekend brunch for a family event. Our server, David, was super friendly and attentive. Lots of choice. The omelet chef, Siena , was superb. The omelets were perfectly cooked and a wide variety of fillings were offered. Tables very perfectly spaced, which provided privacy, making it less noisy than other restaurants.  Amazing service, it has been a while since my wife and I had such a good service at a restaurant.  L'hôtel est vieux ainsi que le resto. Les tapis ont l’air dégueulasses. Je croyais que c’était un nouveau restaurant! Vraiment, passez votre tour!  Food was ok steak was under cooked amd the portions were small for the price also service was not great the restaurant wasn't even full. Also it was really loud amd small children making a lot of noise at the next table. For the price I was expecting a nice romantic evening for my girlfriends birthday instead I had loud kids amd obnoxious tourists  Salmon dish was changed from the last time I visited. At that time, the dish was exquisite. This time the salmon was smothered in a tasteless sauce surrounded by a few puff potatoes. The salmon was tasteless and reminiscent of Captain Highliner from the frozen food section. Brasserie Milton can do better.  Pas mauvais, manque un peu de finesse au prix des assiettes. Les pates aux fruits de mer étaient excellentes, le steak était correcte, simplement servi avec frites du commerce, j'aurais apprécié un 2e accompagnement et la cuisson adéquate.

It such a cute & enchanting atmosphere. 
Perfect to spoil a loved one on a special occasion.  A very delightful experience, love the communication and grateful for the plenty alternatives!  Amazing service and all my friends and I had an amazing time !!  Le magasin est joliment décoré, et les gâteaux (bentos) étaient très bons - mais j’étais un peu déçue par l’expérience. Ils n’avaient plus de gâteaux au chocolat, plus de thé au Jasmin, et pas de sucre rouge pour décorer les bentos. Je pense qu’il serait bon de pouvoir sélectionner son gâteau au préalable pour ne pas être déçu par ce qui est disponible en stock…
Des explications ou juste un peu plus de disponibilité des serveuses auraient été appréciés pour le processus de décoration des bentos.  
Gros bémol à mon avis pour les boîtes à bento: elles sont trop petites, clairement cheap, et finissent par abîmer les rebords du gâteau.

Les thes étaient également excellent nous reviendrons certainement. J’ai mis 4/5 pour le service seulement parce que la personne était seule et débordée donc il pouvait y avoir de l’attente . Toutefois le service en soi était exceptionnel.  Merci pour ce bel après-midi !  I did the bento box decoration which was fun! The cakes were really moist and nice and the frosting was good. I do wish that when first given the cake, it would be given on a plate or a takeout box that can be collapsed so it's easier to decorate (it made decorating hard with the cake already in the takeout container). I do also wish that maybe there were some piping tips available to make some nice designs on the cake.

Last night, however, I found myself on a date that was not going well. Despite the awkwardness of the situation, the staff were incredibly kind and understanding. From the receptionist to the server and even the bartender, everyone showed such compassion and attentiveness.

The servers subtly noticed how things were going and, without being asked, helped bring the evening to a graceful close by bringing the bill early. It was a small but immensely thoughtful gesture that truly made a difference. Their professionalism and humanity shone through, showing the kind of attention you expect from excellent hospitality.

As always, the food was fantastic. My favorite dish is the “la cuisse de canard,” which never disappoints. The cocktails are equally delightful, and the ambiance is just beautiful.

Will come back again  My overall experience was bad. The food was good, but one of my friends had his plate forgotten and only received it after the whole group had finished their meal. In addition, some dishes came with the wrong side and we only received some drinks after asking the waitress a few times. We went with a group of 15 people to celebrate a special occasion (my civil wedding). We brought a cake with a cake topper, which should have been placed on top of the cake when it was brought to the table, as instructed upon arrival at the restaurant. When we ordered the cake, the waitress and another employee arrived with the cake with candles and sang happy birthday. We didn't understand anything. In addition, they lost the topper, which was only found after some time and brought to the table. In addition, the restaurant charges a fee of $3 per person to take the cake. I understand that this is standard practice, after all, we used the restaurant's refrigerator, however, no one helped us cut the cake or serve it.

Steak délicieux. Excellent comme toujours  Everywhere I go the keg is consistently excellent.  Food was great, wine recommendation was great, service was great.

I would definitely eat here again when in Montreal.  Our waiter was amazing.. food never disappoints here.. only thing I found the music too loud and the genre wasn't really for this type of ambiance. Dinner music would have been more appreciated..  Nous sommes arrivés par l'entrée du côté intérieur de la place Ville-Marie, l'hôtesse était froide et sans sourire! Vraiment comme accueil. De plus, elle s'apprêtait à nous donner une table dans la section bar alors que nous avions demandé une table loin du bar et prêt de la fenêtre. Il a fallu insister pour avoir la table demandée alors que nous avions réservé depuis des semaines.

De plus, dans l'ensemble du restaurant, la musique était beaucoup trop forte. Nous voulions manger dans un resto de qualité et non dans un bar sportif.

Enfin, le mode de paiement est malhonnête! En plus de démarrer les choix de pourboire à 18% et non à 15%, celui-ci s'appliquèrent au montant de l'addition après taxes alors qu'un restaurant honnête le fait avant taxes.

Very busy but kept the drinks & food flowing  Votre canard ce midi était vraiment exceptionnel, jai adoré !  I had the filet and my companion had the prime rib - both were excellent!

Waitress and Manager were spectacular.  When they found out that we were visiting from Boston, they sent over a complementary dessert, which was delicious.  My wife and I can't wait to go back.  We arrived and our table was not ready for 10 minutes even though the place was 12/3 full. Once seated it was too warm in main dining roomfor me so i asked waiter if we could move to high tables at bar area he said no problem. My dinner mate ordered for me the same as he ordered,  a baseball steak cut. When the meals arrived 40 min after ordering  i was given some other sirloin type cut and the server tried to convince me i misordered but as stated i didnt even order at all. The manager a slight blond lady in red dress was getting argumentative with my friend and eventually we left. It was a bad experience with no apologies or regrets shared. Poor staff poor experience. To recap: gad reservation was seated late
Food came quite late
Staff was aggressive some members( the slight man manager type said he had just transferred from other location a few days prior)
I had dined at the keg dozens of times and even for quebec the service was below par for a higher end chain. High turnover and poor trainibg does not help. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/51436345.webp

The service was attentive even though our waitress was handling a fairly large number of tables.
The food was 8 on a scale of ten,the only thing I remember to fault was the refrigerated tomatoes has lost most of their flavor in the salad. The pasta was amazing,produced in house no doubt and perfectly prepared.

The food was delicious, we had a kind server, and the food was served quickly.  Very tasty food and great service.  Nice and cossy on a cold night.  Some classic dishes with some modern spin.  Great wine list with affordable options.  Disappointing experience overall. Despite booking a standard table, we were initially  offered a high table, requiring us to request a change. The food was a mixed bag: the salmon dish lacked the promised currant sauce, though the crème brûlée was excellent. Portions were notably small. The meal ended unpleasantly with the waiter pressuring for tips in a rude way. The restaurant needs to pay fair wages to waiters. Regrettably, this visit was not worth it.

Read more Worst restaurant experience of my life. This is a joke for a high end establishment when it comes to treating your customers. Wouldn’t even be acceptable standard by fast food level.

The food was ok, but not great. Service was excellent and ambiance was great… I was just hoping the food would be tastier  Fantastic omakase experience with sashimi and exceptional matching Sake!  We really enjoyed the food but honestly the service was so slow and sporadic. Drinks took 45 mins to come we were holding on ordering food so we could have our drinks first and the server kind of forgot about us.

Amazing menu and large choice  Resultó ser un gran lugar, el espacio está muy cómodo y muy bien decorado, la atención del mesero fue sobresaliente, la comida estupenda, gran lugar  Very tasty an original sushis !

staff is very nice and helpful  This was by far the best sushi I have ever had. The hamachi baby roll is a must try, my boyfriend and I both agreed it was the best roll we’d ever had. I also really loved the avocado truffle tacos, everything was absolutely delicious. Great atmosphere, good music and loved the interior!  Was scrolling for a sushi/sashimi place and happened upon Ryu. It’s on the pricier side but the definition of “get what you pay for” applies here. Their fish is fresh, some sourced directly from Japan, others from the east or west coast.

What I love about the maki here is that they don’t over stuff if either rice. Instead, they include different ingredients to give more flavour and texture to your bite. The maki are best enjoyed with one bite. The other fascinating thing is that they don’t use normal nori. Instead, they opt for a soya paper, which gives it a lighter and more elegant flare. Proper and authentic nigiri and maki should have a balanced temperature between the rice, fish and ingredients. Ryu does it perfectly.

The ambience follows the Japanese “wabi-sabi” concept with exposed concrete paired with wooden accents on the ceiling.

The ambiance the decor the food and staff everything was perfect!  Fantastic service the entire experience was very memorable
The food quality was exceptional and outstanding service
Santiago made the evening  Tiamo is very beautiful restaurant the decoration is just great. But the kitchen area is in the middle of the corridor to go upstairs and it was really messy and breaks with the harmony of the decoration.
I was expecting a delicious tasty Italian food but the food was just ok I had lobster ravioli and my partner had a veggie pizza. The ravioli was very dry and was nothing interesting in the taste or presentation. The pizza was just ok. For dessert we had a tiramisu and cannelloni. The tiramisu was too sweet and the cannelloni with chocolate chips was looking cheap.

Around the 9:00 pm there were new waiters with no uniform that scared a bit when they came to pick up our plates.

If Tiamo works more in the recipes can be more than an Instagram place. For me it was just try and never come back. Read more The staff were very efficient and friendly. Pizza rivaled that of Italy. A little hot upstairs, but bearable. Highly recommended!  Very noisy open space. Food was pricey for what it was but fine. Nothing to write home about, as the expression goes…  First of all the ambiance and decor was gorgeous it was definitely a wonderful place. Do be aware that the place is quite small so the space may be tight, make sure you get a reservation! The food was really good we ordered the soup of the day (4/5), the beef carpaccio (5/5), the vegetarian carpaccio (3/5), the tuna crudo (2/5) - wasn’t fresh and we suspect it was frozen tuna, as well as the brie (4.5/5). Over all the entrees were great and the portions were perfect, we shared everything and we were 5 people. For the mains: lobster ravioli (4/5) - really good but the rosée sauce is overpowering and the lobster taste is very mild, bolognese (4/5) very good but of course it remains a very classical dish, Alfredo pasta (3/5) the sauce was delicious but the chicken was a bit dry and mushrooms flavour was overpowering, confit de canard pizza (4.5/5) very good just wished a bit more duck, 4 fromagi pizza (5/5). I saw some people complaining for the price of cocktails but the average in Montreal is between 15-18 so to be they were perfect and they tasted amazing, we also had a bottle of white wine. The young man that served us was very attentive and very quick, the rest of people who served us were very kind and friendly :) the service was fast and we stayed from 7:30 to 9:30 no complaints! Read more Overall the food was nothing special. Average experience overall  Not what I expected. It took a while formeaiter to

We tried to omit a singular ingredient in one dish due to gluten intolerance and they refused to serve us the entire dish and told us to order off the “sides” menu instead.

L'ambiance était énergisante et parfaite pour un dîner entre amis. Le restaurant est peut-être un peu bruyant pour un souper romantique. Mais ça dépend des goûts...  Compared to before the epidemic, the portion size is much smaller and the price-performance ratio is not high. A bit disappointed：(  Food was delicious!  I recommend having maple syrup on hand for coffee etc and carrying almond milk.  First time there and the tables were a bit close together but sat next to the window. Food was absolutely outstanding!  I was excited to try this new restaurant, hoping for a unique blend of French and Indian cuisine, but sadly, it fell short of my expectations. As someone with a deep love for Indian flavors and with a partner from Punjab, we were both left underwhelmed.

The concept of French-Indian fusion is intriguing, but the execution felt lacking. The dishes, while well-presented, didn’t deliver the bold and rich spices that Indian cuisine is known for. There was a noticeable absence of depth in the curries and sauces, which left me wanting more flavor. Unfortunately, there was also no dessert with Indian inspiration—something I would have expected to round off the meal and balance the fusion concept.

The drinks, which we hoped would creatively mirror the fusion of cultures, felt disconnected from the theme. They didn’t elevate the experience as we anticipated, falling short of complementing the meal or embracing the French-Indian blend.

I wanted to give this restaurant 5 stars for its concept, ambiance, and effort, but the flavors just didn’t meet the mark for us. Read more We shared 3 appetizers, chef’s creation, scallops korma & chicken tandoori, fabulous.

Love the ambiance @ the Palm Court!  J'ai fêté mon anniversaire et Guillaume a été très attentionné en me faisant de beaux souhaits. Merci !!  The venue is beautiful, with amazing ambiance. The service was incredibly slow, especially given the high expectations for the ritz Carleton. The food was okay, but you could tell it had been sitting for a while before being brought out. The evening I went it was not busy at all, but took 15-20 minutes for each drink to arrive, and getting the waiter over to your table to take your drink order also took too long (especially since our empty drinks were on full display at the table). Overall, for the stigma of one of the best hotels, as well as for the high price of food and 30$+ drinks, I expected a better experience in terms of service, efficiency, food, and time it takes to get food/drink. Definitely not inclined to come back to this particular location. Read more Robin was Excellent. Food was great as always.

The bartenders are incredible and a few of them have told us wonderful stories about the history of the place and the old stars who used to visit.

We also spoke with multiple staff, non of which showed interest in us or made any small talk. The food is good but overpriced, especially the gnocchi. Also, I found it odd that there was no complimentary bread for the price of the meal. This sounds like a small complaint, but when a pasta dish is 50% marinara then it's hard to enjoy when you're left with a bowl of sauce. And for reference, my local IGA in the city sells fresh baguettes for 3$ so it's not much to ask for.

We were first placed less than two feet beside two different occupied guests' tables resulting in the staff hitting me twice with a cheese wheel. At least the staff gave us a new table and were nice about it when I asked, but the new table was on uneven ground and rattled our dishes all night.

Quand au pain qu’il faut payer il ne nous a pas plu. C’était un pain brioché bon en soi mais qui ne s’accorde absolument pas avec un repas . Les portions sont petites dans ce resto et il n’y a pas de légumes dans l’assiette de filet mignon. Le prix des bouteilles de vin débute à 100$. Toutefois le service est impeccable.

The stale sesame seeds hurt the overall taste. The butter for the bread was near rancid. We opted not to stay for dinner. Service was good. Atmosphere was odd. My view was of the hotel elevator doors.  Overall my experience was great. The food was prepared well and tasty. Seasoned well. The octopus could have had a bit more char to it but that’s me nitpicking. The bartender did a great job on drinks. The only difference as an American is that fountain drinks aren’t refillable.

Toutefois, le service n’était pas top. Les serveurs ne faisaient pas vivre une expérience. Ils faisaient leur travail, sans passion. La bouffe était bonne, sans plus. Je ne reviendrai pas, malheureusement. Read more Le rapport quantité-prix fait honnêtement dur. Des plats qui sont « advertised » comme des plats principaux représentent en fait des entrées.

A bit like a village tavern, like the ones we grew up with in Provence.

We wanted to bring out that little touch of craziness that we all have, mix cultures like Montreal teaches us to do, mix ages and differences, and above all, show great conviviality in a place that reflects us.

So, come to June to enjoy a good glass of wine selected by our sommelier accompanied by appetizers or a good seasonal dish crafted by our chef and his team of enthusiasts.

June is an unpretentious place where we welcome you in the same way you would welcome us into your home; with honesty, simplicity, and a cheeky little glass of wine in hand.

Welcome home!","Read more Pretty little eating stop!  Service was lovely.  Items on the menu were interesting and we got our food quickly.  Ma meilleure amie et moi voulions essayer ce resto depuis 1 an. Quelle déception. À notre arrivée, nous n’avons pas eu la table que nous avions spécifiquement demandé lors de notre réservation 1 mois auparavant. Ensuite ça a prit 1h à la serveuse avant de venir nous voir. La nourriture était inégale. Le crudo de pétoncle éclipsait complètement le goût du crustacé. Par chance, notre serveuse nous a permis de changer de table à mi-chemin. Le service ne s’est par ailleurs pas accéléré, les serveuses jasaient avec d’autres client et ça nous a prit 30 minute obtenir un autre verre de vin. Bref, quel désastre. La serveuse nous à offert un shooter et un verre de vin, mais ça n’a pas amélioré notre soirée qui s’est étendue sur 3h30 (sans que nous le voulions, les plats étaient juste excessivement long avant d’arriver). Le vin était bon. Peut être que pour un 5@7, ce serait une bonne option. Read more Great food, value, friendly staff. Would come again.  Had a wonderful experience, waitress was lovely and food was great. Recommend the rigatoni, was prepared very well, shared with a nice bottle of wine and some cocktails to start.  Perfect evening with a great atmosphere.  Excellent restaurant! Les plats sont recherchés et les vins sont excellents.  Excellent, friendly service. Well priced considering the high quality of the food and wine. Nothing common about the alcohol selection or the meal options. Great date night or small group gathering.  Amazing experience! The cocktails were fun and well balanced, had a Lavender Negroni, London Mule and a natural Italian wine which was recommended by the sommelier. He was very knowledgeable! I recommend everything on the menu but specially the gnocchi, scallop crudo, burrata sourdough bread & cromesquis.  Absolutely amazing experience. Sat at the bar, the bartender was so helpful with selecting wine and explaining the menu. Would highly recommend and will be coming back!  We really enjoyed our evening! We will definitely be back.

The breakfasts were amazing and the service was wonderful. We ate dinner on several occasions and the braised beef was delicious and tender. Fun cocktails and again great staff.  From what was advertised and their menu, there was very little for the cold buffet. The prepared meals were ok overall. Service was great but not worth it your looking for buffet. If you have time to walk sound Montreal, I’d recommend to look around and see what else there is. Overall, it was ok.  Room was quite cold. Guest were not comfortable. Quality of Food was mediocre at best.  Repas très bon. Ambiance ok.

Belle sélection de thé également et jus d’oranges pressées frais  Le serveur ou bien le supérieur, de notre serveuse qui faisait super bien son travail et qui nous a offert un très bon service,  parlait très fort pour réprimander d une certaine façon notre serveuse,  tout les clients dans le restaurant l entendait parler,  ce n était pas nécessaire à notre avis et ca aurait pu être fait avec plus de discrétion,  c est le seul point négatif sur notre visite à votre restaurant, à mon avis  cette personne devrait penser aux clients et non à sa petite personne.....

We had ordered soup which was warmed up to our satisfaction. She was quite friendly and engaging as well. I had Salmon which was excellent  I stayed in Le Westin on recent conference trip to Montreal. I found Gazette, in/adjacent to the hotel, the perfect place to ""hold 2 person meetings"" over a meal or tea/coffee because the staff is friendly, the noise level was very low (except maybe Happy Hour), and there were good food choices.  Perfect food, drink, and timing!  We can't wait to return!  Food was very good. Kids salmon was a bit undercooked (rare not medium in middle). Rest was on point. Service was excellent.  Definitely recommend the Gazette restaurant. We had the perfect corner table facing windows and the busy Montreal streets. Our server was attentive but did not interrupt the flow of conversations between 4 friends sharing a reunion.  Merci beaucoup!  For a hotel restaurant,  they have very good food. Great portion sizes, and great prices for the amount of food. Would definitely eat here again staying at this hotel.  I actually didn’t realize when booking that this was a hotel restaurant (in the Westin), and that really wasn’t what we were looking for (which I will own). Food was pretty good. I would say 4 out of 5, in comparison to many other restaurant options in Montreal however. Didn’t feel like it held up the “exceptional” rating, but was a good meal.  Ate here for the buffet breakfast during our stay at Le Westin. Excellent brunch with lots of great options.  Service was excellent.

This was our second visit! We stopped here our first night in Montreal. Travelling with my 83 year old mother who LOVES mussels. We shared a generous pot of mussels and a salad, and she had wine. We took some cheesecake to go which was divine. Liked it so much we popped in again last night. She had the mussels and wine again, and I had the fish tacos and an N/A beer. And again we took the cheesecake to go. Both time the staff was so friendly and attentive (but not overly so), and my mother wanted me to add that the staff was also quite cute!

Un accueil souriant, installées confortablement sur un jolie terrasse, des plats copieux et délicieux, un service impeccable et particulièrement chaleureux, nous avons passé une excellente soirée!  The chicken sandwich was very good, as were the fish tacos. The french fries were very tiny and kind of cold, I thought it was the bottom of the bag. The server said that their fries are ""tiny bites"" which I thought was strange as I've never seen tiny bite fries. I ordered a drink from the bar and because they had a large party the bar was backed up and I got my drink after my meal. The server was very polite, they were just consumed with a large party out back which affected our little table for two. But the main course was simple but very delicious. Read more We had a group of three for a 6:30 PM reservation on the back terrace that had a lovely atmosphere, especially with the summer Montréal weather! Unfortunately, we received our food much later than the other tables—including tables that were seated and that had ordered after us. Because one person in our party had an event to go to, we paid for our dinner when our entrées finally arrived. While the food and drinks were quite tasty, it was not worth the wait we faced.

Welcome to Moretti William","Le cadre est joli, la nourriture est bonne, mais la serveuse laisse à désirer (ce dernier point est relatif).  The service was excellent, they were very attentive and the pizzas had great taste. I recommend!  Not great. Pastas better from lulus for a fraction of the price. Dishes were dirty. Glassware was dirty. It just seems like moretti is expanding too fast to keep up the quality they once had.

So many good restaurants in Montreal… especially Italian ones… I hate leaving bad reviews :(

Last note - who ever trained the waitresses to stand behind you when the tip option comes  is a genius. I was adamant on leaving a generous tip for the service… 15%, but instead tipped 18% because it was quicker just to tap one of the options on screen so I could get the waitress to stop breathing down my neck. That was exciting. Read more Drinks were very good. I had the beef capaccio. Its was excellent. Pizza are also amazing! Overall food is tasty.  Great location. Nice vibe. Food was really good. Was surprised they didn’t have a cocktail menu and when asked waitress she was like ‘we make all the classics’ with the enthusiasm of a floating rock. Second time I go to a Moretti restaurant and second time either the waitress or barmaid could care less about your experience.  Wife ordered the rigatoni and she was not able to finish her dish as some of the noddles were not cooked. About a quarter of the noodles. We enjoyed the tuna tartar that was served on the fried rice. Caesar salad was good but smaller portion than described. I took the steak and fries. Steak was slightly overcooked (no big deal), not much taste or seasoning (steak spice) only flavor was the charred the steak had. The fries accompanied by the dish were certainly leftovers from another batch as they were overcooked and hard. Seasoned too heavily with salt. As for dessert, we enjoyed the Tiramisu, and the cheese cake. Overall happy for Moretti for opening a new location but was disappointed by the quality of food that we ordered, especially since it did not represent fair value to the price we were paying.

SANTOS ORIGINS
All the streets in Old Montreal are named after saints. The location being at the intersection of Saint-Paul and Saint-François-Xavier streets, and offering Spanish-style tapas cuisine, it was natural to name the restaurant ""Saints"" in Spanish.

OUR MISSION
""Feed & Amuse"" translates from English to French as ""Nourrir & Amuser."" It is our promise to our customers to always feed their imagination and their stomach. As for amusing, we do it every day through special events, our dynamic staff, enchanting decor, and music.","Read more The ladies night special is very underrated and deserves way more praise!!

We were three girls, therefore we shared 6 tapas and we had more than enough food to eat The best part, our wine glasses were never empty, and all for the 40$!!?? That's an amazing deal!! Could not recommend this restaurant more! :) Read more Wonderful date night experience. We had the popcorn chicken, fried chicken sandwich, grilled octopus, and beef barbacoa tostada, along with a mojito and a margarita for drinks. It was tasty and exciting all-around. The music is quite loud, so something to keep in mind, depending on what ambiance you like; however, the genre was a good fit with the vibe of the restaurant. Pleasant and helpful staff - we had a great time! Read more Le Santos m’a été recommandé par un des mes amis pour mon anniversaire. C’était la première fois que j’y allais. Nous étions un groupe de 7 personnes. Le service était lent et désorganisé. La serveuse avait l’air débordée. La nourriture nous a été servie de manière saccadée, c’est-à-dire un plat après l’autre avec plusieurs minutes d’attente entre leur arrivés. La nourriture était moyenne. Certains plats n’avaient pas ou très peu d’assaisonnement. Nous étions déçues considérant que c’est un restaurant mexicain. De plus, plusieurs plats n’étaient pas disponible, ce qui était dommage et diminuait considérablement le menu qui offre déjà très peu de choix.  Cela a pris une éternité afin de recevoir notre facture et de pouvoir la payer.

Par la suite, nous sommes descendues au première étage lorsque le restaurant s’est transformé en club. Nous avons commandé une bouteille de champagne. La serveuse nous a garanti que nous pouvions avoir une table suite à notre commande. Du à leur manque d’organisation, toutes les tables étaient déjà prise. Nous avions fini par partir.

Une des choses qui valait la peine est le dj. Il a su mettre l’ambiance malgré ce fiasco. Read more 1/ COLD temperature. There were 2 ACs at the entrance turned on to 18 and 20 C. It's insanely cold. We had to wear out jackets.
2/ MUSIC. It was supposed to be a throwback music. What's been promoted on Social media didn't happen.
3/ FOOD. Extremely expensive for an average quality.

Shout out to the staff. They were kind and professional. Read more We loved it! Warm welcome, great service.
Good happy hours and $1 oysters.
Wonderful  Ambience was amazing. The waiter was okay she seemed nicer towards the end. Food was really good. What annoyed me was how loud the music was so I couldn’t really talk to my friend, we had to like scream at each other. But honestly the food was great.  They forgot to bring one of my dishes and it took almost an hour half for my main.  Ambiance is good, but expect bland and overpriced food.  Le menu qui nous a été présenté lors de la réservation de type expérience n’était pas ce que nous avons eu de servi lors du souper.

I am a foodie and I know japanese food very well so I was expecting better for the food, unfortunately. It was tasty and if you know nothing about Japanese food it's totally fine but if you know a bit, food is not so great. The fried chicken (kara-age) was ok but tasted too oily and the chicken was not juicy as it should. The grilled mackerel (saba shyouyaki) was not good. It was grilled but it was marinated. It is usually served marinated or fresh and grilled, but not both. The salad and salmon tartare were good to be fair, so I think they need a bit more research or advice for the menu and it will improve. Overall, it's not more expensive than other restaurants (100$ for two with one drink), but the quality was below the price this time.

Thank you Read more Small portions, karage too much breading, squid was too fishy (didn't seem fresh), and miso was the smallest serving (barely half cup, nonetheless a bowl-ful, comes in a cup!)

We sat for over 30 minutes past our reservation time and we never spoken too from any of the staff. Finally we got fed up and left; we ended up having an amazing dinner at Rosters (in Alexis Neon) instead. 

My advice, never bother with the fourm’s “restaurant” it’s a waste of time.

Read more This was my first experience at Cineplex! I loved it. The food took a little long to come out, but my server who was just the sweetest explained that the kitchen was running behind and discounted my meal. The best service, good food, good prices. Recommend and will go again!  My fries were cold and my crispy chicken burger was crispy but tasteless. My son’s chicken wings were also lacking in taste. 
My husband’s fries were hot and the burgers ordered were good apparently.  It was complicated to reserved thé VIP lounge. I reserved it online but i wasnt enough i also had to reserved it there and no one new how.. exept thé manager..  Nothing was available on the menu. We had to change at least 4 of our initial choices. Service was a little slow even though we were the only ones there. Food was okay for the price.  Place was almost empty and the service took long. One of the bartenders was watching tv most of the time. We ordered food before the movie and we got our food when the movie started. Other people got the food before us.
Compared with last time this time was very disappointing.  VIP was sold out but we were still able to reserve a table in the lounge, so we thought we could sit, have a drink and play pool. At arrival, the doorman did not let us in despite reservation. We were not “checked in”. In fact we were ridiculed and could have saved the trip, and killed some time elsewhere.

Everything on the menu is amazing.  Notre première expérience du Mui Mui! Nous étions avec mes parents et ma fille de 7 ans. Nous nous sommes laissés tenter par le menu dégustation. 3 services, une douzaine de plats différents au total. Bien que ce menu soit certes un très bon rapport qualité-prix, si c’était à refaire, nous irions avec des plats à la cartes pour avoir moins de variétés de goût. Pour nous, d’avoir autant de goût différents ça nous a fait moins apprécier chaque plat, surtout rendu au 3e service. Nos coup de coeur: thon albacore, tataki de boeuf, dumpling de courge, dumplings de canard-betteraves, côtes-levées. Attention! Le chow mein nous a surpris car il était trop piquant pour nous.

The service was excellent—friendly and attentive, with lots of smiles throughout. Would definitely recommend!  Overall good experience. Food was delicious. Service could have been better.

De plus, lors d’un contact avec le restaurant pour confirmer la réservation du soir durant la journée de vendredi, on avait pris en note les allergies de notre fille en nous disant que « quelque chose pourrait être servi comme dessert maintenant qu’on sait ses allergies alimentaires ». Malgré ça elle n’a rien reçu comme dessert d’anniversaire malgré qu’il aurait été possible pour le restaurant d’avoir des articles de la compagnie « ange gardien » qui sont des produits exempts des plus importants allergènes. C’est un manque de Keg pour que l’expérience d’une personne allergique soit optimale. Ce serait très simple de prendre soin de tous les clients de façon égale.

Using premium materials designed and manufactured in Montreal, the elements marry themselves wonderfully. Bright and vibrant colors give a WOW factor that will make you feel like in a modern Milan hotel. The creation of the open kitchen concept never seen before in the Montreal area allows you to see the best chefs in the region at work.

Gatto Matto’s avant-garde and modern Italian menu was developed by our talented chef and co-owner, Ara Ekmekdjian. This multi-dimensional chef first studied the art of classical French cuisine under Richard Bastien at Lemeac. He then focused his attention on perfecting his Italian culinary skills at Beatrice. His desire to master his craft later led him to join the creative team at Le Chien Fumant, where he worked tirelessly to achieve the rank of Chef de Cuisine.","Read more Belle ambiance chic et décontractée , les plats sont bien exécutés mais il ne faut pas s’attendre à de grosses portions, malgré les prix assez élevés.

We are from Manitoba- so our French is essentially non existent. Our server, Dominique, was amazing! Very attentive, friendly and engaging. Our food was also 10/10 (the Keg ALWAYS delivers!). Establishment was very clean and the hosts were also so friendly and were very understanding of our complete lack of French speaking abilities lol. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Montreal! Read more Good food, quiet place and great service. Overall very nice place  Très connaissants sur les allergies alimentaires aux noix. L’assistant directeur s’est même déplacé pour nous l’expliquer sans qu’on l’ai demandé. Nous avons grandement apprécié ainsi que le service et la nourriture.  Notre dernière visite au Keg de St-Bruno

Nous sommes arrivés à 17h15 pour notre première visite dans ce Keg, après avoir réservé en ligne plus d'une semaine à l'avance pour célébrer un anniversaire. À notre arrivée, le restaurant était encore très calme, avec peu de clients. On nous a assigné une table visiblement plus sombre que les autres. En demandant si l'éclairage pouvait être ajusté, la serveuse nous a informés que la lumière au-dessus de notre table était défectueuse. La seule solution proposée était une petite lampe d'appoint, mais aucun changement de table n'était possible.

Bien que la lumière naturelle de l'extérieur compensait un peu, l'atmosphère est rapidement devenue trop sombre à mesure que la soirée avançait. Nous avons commandé nos boissons et nos plats, et tout est arrivé avec une rapidité surprenante, presque comme une course, même si le restaurant était encore à moitié vide.

Les plats principaux sont arrivés tellement vite qu'on aurait dit qu'ils avaient été lancés sur la table. Le service semblait précipité, sans réelle raison, et la lumière déclinante rendait l'expérience de plus en plus désagréable.

Nous avons terminé notre repas et, faute de visibilité, avons décidé de partir rapidement. En demandant la facture, j'ai remarqué deux gâteaux d'anniversaire accompagnés de bougies étincelantes passer pour une autre table. Il semble que, malgré ma réservation spécifique pour un anniversaire, cette attention ne nous a pas été offerte. Peut-être aurions-nous dû payer un supplément pour avoir droit à ces petites étincelles?

En sortant, j'ai pris le temps de mentionner au jeune homme à l'entrée qu'il serait préférable de ne plus offrir cette table sans lumière aux clients. Sa réponse? ""Je sais, mais c'est comme ça, si vous voulez vous plaindre, parlez au gérant.""

Le Keg a réussi à perdre un client fidèle ce soir-là. Le service était médiocre, l'atmosphère sombre et oppressante, et la nourriture était correcte, mais sans plus. Bref, une expérience Read more Mon mari et moi étions présents pour souligner notre 1er anniversaire de mariage. On nous a offert un verre de mousseux chacun en guise de félicitations ! Merci énormément !
Nourriture plus que parfaite, nous avons rouler jusqu'à la voiture haha! Notre serveuse super gentille (de même que tout le personnel)!  
Nous avons hâte d'y retourner! Read more our reservation was for 7pm. We had to wait til 7:30 for a table with a whole crowd of people. Spoiled my ev enoing. After that all was good. Pedro the waiter was excellent.  Décevant cette fois ci, nous sommes des clients réguliers et n’avons pas apprécié l’accueil. Il y avait beaucoup de monde dans l’entrée et c’était chaotique tellement que deux groupes arrivés après nous ont été assis avant nous. Ça part mal disons. Nous sommes souvent placés dans le fond du restaurant, je sais pas pourquoi ça tombe toujours sur nous! La nourriture moyenne, trempette aux champignons froide dans le fond. Petit steak et pomme de terre monte Carlo sans goût et pas assez cuite. En plus la coors light était dégazée!

Cela fait plus de 25 ans que nous allons dans ce restaurant au départ dans le vieux port et maintenant à Saint-Bruno car c’est plus près de notre résidence.

Nous allons attendre un moment avant d’y retourner! Read more Le Keg n'est plus ce qu'il était.
Maintenant, c'est ordinaire. Certains serveurs(es) sont très pressés de faire tourner leur table et vous poussent a commander rapidement.
Les gens viennent manger en gougounes et sweat pants.
Nous avons même vécu dernièrement se faire donner notre facture sans nous demander si l'on voulait un café ou dessert puisque nous avions atteint le fameux 2hrs d'occupation.
Notre soirée écourtée était quand même de 375$ avant pourboire.
Donc, au lieu de donner 20% de pourboire, j'ai laissé 15%.
Nous aurions surement dépensé un autre 50$.
Au final, la serveuse a reçu 55$ au lieu de 85$ Read more Notre serveuse était très accueillante et à l’écoute. Très souriante.

Service impeccable comme à chaque fois!  The food is good, the staff is really nice, cozy ambiance, when I feel like eating vegan, it is my favorite spot ! :)  We arrived at the restaurant and entered. There were about 10 customers total in the restaurant / on the terrace. 1 employee was around kitchen window, 1 at the bar and 1 wondering in between. We waited around 4-5 minutes before someone actually came to seat us.

Once seated, we ordered our drinks and food in a decent amount of time. I ordered the risotto and my girlfriend ordered a sushi platter. We got told that it would take about 25-30 minutes for the sushi and she asked if that would be ok. We said yes. What we didn’t know is that my risotto arrived 10 minutes after we ordered so we thought that the sushi would follow soon after so I started eating very slowly since it was hot. I finished the risotto and the sushi arrived 15 minutes after that so we both ended up eating alone while the other one was looking at you eat. This was very very weird as they could have prepared the risotto to come out at the same time as the sushi.

Our Mains were the Chicken Kebab and the Beef Kebab and they were both delish! Oh don’t forgot to order their French Fires as a side as they make a perfect complement to the mains - but mention to the waiter that with the fries ordered - unless you are very hungry - the chef can forgot about including the roasted potatoes with the mains. Definitely a return visit is called for with other family members. Read more Real tasty Lebanese Authentic food.

1 word Amazing it was our first time everyone loved it and want to come back for sure!  Excellente nourriture, abordable et excellent service!  Superbe accueil, chaleureux et belle ambiance. La brisket de boeuf est un incontournable je la recommande sans hésiter. Merci à l’équipe Laval Ouest!  Great place! Amazing staff! Customer service experience was outstanding. Food was good. Ribs were not as tender and juicy as I would of expected. Fried chicken is phenomenal. Mac & cheese is addictive because it’s so delicious. Highly recommended!  Unfortunately for the price, the food wasn’t that great. Brisket was dry, pulled pork lack of flavour, chicken under average. Only the sausage was worthy of good bbq. We had the platter for 2. Also, during that evening police had to intervene du to altercation between staff. Would not recommend. Spent a fair amount of money for a poor dinner.  We celebrated my 1st Mother's Day with a yummy lunch at Rubs. I had a huge burger and my partner had a mixed platter. The staff was amazing! I even got a delicious free donut for the occasion, how sweet is that! We will be back! Thank you again to our awesome waitress and Mathieu. :)  Viandes tellement salées que c’était impossible à manger.  Burger de porc style côtes levées mais aucune mention sur le menu.  Bavette de boeuf de mauvaise qualité et pleine de nervures donc immangeable.  Une vrai déception et un gaspillage d’argent pour un repas pas mangeable.  Je ne recommanderais à personne d’y aller.

Firstly, our servers were there as soon as we sat.  Very friendly and polite staff.  We started with the snow crab raviolis, which was delicate and delicious.  We then had a salad course, the golden beet salad was perfect, my friend had the caesar salad which was also very good.  The main course took 45mins to get to the table after they removed our plates.  We had no bread or anything to keep us busy, however the other tables around us had all been served, and they were larger tables, while we were only 2.  The main dishes were also perfectly cooked when we did receive them, however they were lukewarm and the plates were piping hot.  It was obvious that they were sitting at the window for a while.  The duck was a perfect medium rare and delicious.  The salmon was also prepared to perfection.  The desserts were equally wonderful.  Crème brulée and blueberry cheesecake. 
The noise level is quite high in certain sections.  The wine by the glass wasn't even close to 5oz, at the most I was served maybe 4...

The only downside was the service which was indifferent.  Drink refills were non-existent and if you wanted something you had to get up from your table and go find a staffer.

Reservations: restaurant@chateau-vaudreuil.com","Just great, as usual. Unfortunately the main dining room was closed.  Les pâtes au déjeuner furent excellentes, service impeccable, on aime bien cet endroit relaxant!  We celebrated our 22nd anniversary with the most amazing dinner! Live lounge music was playing and the restaurant was energetic, so we could enjoy ourselves as we laughed and reminisced about the last 22 years of life! We started with sharing the salmon tartare and micro green seasonal salad.....both of which were fantastic, especially the dressing on the salad! We shared the lobster ravioli and then had each had an entree that was the shining star of the night! The black cod melted in your mouth like butter and the bok choy in the fish sauce was perfectly cooked and delicious. The lamb chops were unbelievable and prepared just as asked.... medium rare, with a generous portion of seasonal carrots. Absolutely wonderful staff and ambiance and a perfect end to our day, that started at the Presidents Cup. We will be back to the hotel and Villa Elina for sure! Read more Excellent food and service. We had a quiet table by the window as requested. Everything was perfect.  Fabulous

Thank you for a wonderful evening Read more Breakfast selection is very limited, no eggs Benedict. Service very nice and attentive. Very oily egg white omelette. Thank you for taking the time to highlight my dad's 90th birthday.  An amazing gem with superb service! The food and cocktails were outstanding! The view was fantastic with the charming music. Perfect for our anniversary.  Our black cod and scallops were delicious! Ambiance and derive top notch!  You have wonderful staff and a grand location!  The three filet mignons were excellent and my rack of lamb was delicious although it was more blue than pink.  My heirloom carrots were undercooked - beyond crunchy, and the lobster ravioli was average.

Jean-Pierre and your sommelier were superb.

All in all, it was a pleasant evening although a bit on the expensive side. Read more Superbe soirée pour célébrer les 17 ans de notre fille !

Like the bustling taverns of Venice, Bàcaro Urban Pizzeria is all about making our clients feel at home or, shall we say, in our home, Italy.
The Venetian bácaros have always been a unique meeting place for friends, usually a small humble restaurant serving simple and good food, young local wines- the ideal place to drink a glass of wine and grab a bite to eat while chatting the day or night away. Patrons of the bacaro enjoy an 'ombretta', a glass of wine, with some homemade Italian specialties such as wood burning oven pizzas and baked pastas.","Read more Un excellent restaurant, les produits sont toujours frais, la pizza est délicieuse avec la petite huile et condiments en plus.  Belle place, belle terrasse, bon service, bonne bouffe!  Temps d'attente long. Par contre la serveuse était très attentionnée et l'endroit est toujours aussi bruyant donc parfait avec des enfants. Ce n'est pas la 1ère fois et j'ai toujours apprécié mais ma dernière visite m'a déçue.  Excellent repas. Qualité-prix excellent. Service impeccable. La nourriture était sublime, avec beaucoup de choix de menu. Le fait de pouvoir amener notre vin est très apprécié.  Nous avons mangé des moules-frites (nous avions 6 choix de sauce-crème). J'aurais donné un 5 pour l'évaluation....Mais....LE BRUIT À L'INTÉRIEUR ÉTAIT INFERNAL.  Nous avons mangé sur la terrasse.  Nous allons y retourner mais jamais nous ne mangerons à l'intérieur.  Vous perdez sûrement des clients à cause de ce bruit d'enfer (cacophonie à un très haut niveau-discordance des voix et du son des plus désagréables à l'intérieur.

George owner always makes you feel like family  Excellent service de la part de Lili-Rose. la nourriture est toujours à la hauteur de nos attentes.

We had made reservations prior to our arrival at this restaurant. The waiter seemed unaware of our reservation, but thankfully there were plenty of seating options as the restaurant wasn’t busy. We had specified at the time of reservation that we were celebrating a birthday, however this was not acknowledged at all while we were there. The waiter was quick to take our order. Initially we wanted the charcuterie board, however we told that the chef didn’t have all the items on hand to make this. We decided to go with the brie instead and it was delicious. All in all, we’d give this place another shot if we happen to go back to this area. Read more Nous nous sommes faits rajouter un frais “service”, probablement parce qu’on a pensé qu’on était étrangers et que l’on ne connaissait pas le fonctionnement du pourboire. Dommage, j’avais l’intention de donner un bon pourboire mais ce geste m’a plutôt offusqué.  Je ne sais pas s'il y avait un manque d'employés en cuisine mais c'était très long avant d'avoir notre repas, normalement ce n'est pas comme ça et pourtant, il n'y avait que 4 tables. L'Accueil de Lyne était parfaite et encore une fois elle a su nous accommoder. Nous y retournerons en espérant pouvoir luncher en dedans d'une heure.  Our server was very nice and the ambiance was very nice. The only thing is that the food took a really long time to come and by the time it came at least half of our meals were cold, and we had to get almost all of them reheated. For the food I feel like it’s very overpriced for what you get. It’s a small quantity and it doesn’t taste that amazing. To be honest.  Food was cool, fruits in drinks were frozen… never had such a bad experience… also, when it comes time to pay they ask you to tip, they don’t tell you that they automatically put 18% tip added to the amount, and ask you for a minimum of 18% added (servers leave with 36% tip, which that is steeling if you ask me. Thank god I’m a server and picked up on that nasty scam!  À la hauteur de mes attentes, très bon business lunch malgré le fait que lorsque nous sommes arrivés, il n'y avait pas de serveuse. Lyne à pris ça en charge et tout s'est bien déroulé grâce à son professionnalisme et son excellent service à la clientèle. Nous y retournerons sous peu.  Le restaurant était fermé lorsque nous sommes arrivés. Nous n'avons pas pu manger même si nous avions réservé la veille et avions appelé. Très décevant.  I was surprised to see that i was charged $3 for the bread.  Parfait pour un lunch d'affaire, nous avons pu manger en moins d'une heure.  Il ni avait aucun choix sur le menu. Je ne comprends pas!  Avoir une si belle carte et rien dessus! Ouf!
Après avoir mangé l’entrée, qui n’était pas très bonne soif une, nous avons décidé d’aller manger ailleurs. Et c’était une très bonne idée de quitter!

Nothing wrong with the service, the waitress was really attentive was quick to check up. The food quality seems to have gone a bit on the wayside. The pad thai noodles were not fresh and the chicken fingers were just ""fine"". 

Our total bill came up to about 85$ for two dishes and drinks. Compared to our last visit, the price jumped by at least 15%.

The pizza was thrown together to make it look good but in reality there was not much toppings so it was not very enjoyable.

We were in no hurry and was nice to feel like we weren’t being pushed out the door!  Great food . Great service . Beautiful terrace . Overall 100% enjoyable experience  Very tasty cocktails. Very raucous but we went on a Friday night. Sweet waitress, offered to split the birthday girl’s dinner onto everyone else’s bill. My friend asked for her pasta with cheese sauce on the side, but it wasn’t. Waitress was miffed because she had asked for it.  Food was fantastic, however the waitress did not come very often. We were 3 guests and only 2 of us received water as the third person was running slightly late, after requesting water for the 3rd time we never received it. By that time we had paid our bill already. Also, it was for a birthday - the person didn’t want to stand up on the chair infront of the whole restaurant but nobody came to sing or bring a piece of cake and it was a little dissapointing!
