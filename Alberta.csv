Unfortunately, it was totally disappointing. Totally raw vegetables, shells in oysters, steak was normal but too fatty. NO hostess at the entrance, we were wondering around the restaurant while someone asked what are we looking for. Dirty table and candle stand was cracked I barely cut my finger. Cocktails NOT as per standards - watery and no taste. Read more We were put in the back by the bar area. It was noises we didn’t like that. I ordered the lollipop steak it didn’t have a price included when ordering. When the bill came out it was 180$ , I was totally shocked it was not worth that kind of money. I will not be going there again. Too much money our bill was 400$ for just me and my wife.  Delicious food and drinks. Great service. Would return 100%  It’s more run on as casual nice food rather fine/elegant dining. Both my steak and my server were wearing cow boy hats make the vibe vivid and chill.

Came on my own at around 5pm when only five tables were dining. Ordered their daily feature Butcher’s Cut which is a 16oz Ribeye with baked beans. Also ordered a side of broccoli which was supposed to be a shared plate. The disappointment was caused by not being informed with the baked beans before ordering and that my broccolini was missed on my order. Service was very friendly and polite, but not professional with such an easy order. Maybe they just not in work mode yet seeing a young man stepping in early in the evening…

Steak was of high quality and cooked to perfection. Baked beans, although I wouldn’t order, was still very tasty.

They have a great selections of steak sauces, making it a nice place for those who enjoy steaks with sauces. I had chimichurri, bone marrow butter, and peppercorn. Chim remained the best cold sauce in my mind; fresh and neutralize the fat on steak. Bone marrow butter was recommended by the server but added very little flavour to the steak given the ribeye was already with strong flavour. Peppercorn sauce was not creamy but gel-like, and is honestly the worst that I have tried; very light with no pepper flavour at all; tasted not cooked in restaurant but pre-made or packaged.

There were only two dessert options and neither sounded attractive to me. Read more The food, the service, everything was excellent. Would definitely go back  Super underwhelmed. Brie appetizer was served cold, not melty at all. Chicken was super salty, Steak was good but nothing to write home about. Veggies on plate weren’t cooked. Not worth the $300  We ordered the hanger steak and a chicken supreme. It was fabulously cooked and delicious. The servers we had were so attentive and friendly. Great atmosphere, would definitely go back. 5/5 :)  Filet mignon cuit à la perfection. Pommes de terre Yuyon à l'ail délicieuse et très bien excécutées. Service attentionné. la partie bar n'est pas la plus calme. musique très forte. la prochaine fois j'irai m'installer dans la salle à manger. Prix raisonnable.  Amazing as always! Great food and great service! Cocktails were delicious, steak cooked to perfection!  We came to Edmonton for the Metallica 72 Seasons event and searched for a recommended steakhouse. We found Lux and it exceeded our expectations!! We ordered Surf and Turf which was done and seasoned to perfection, paired with a great bottle of wine and topped it with the to die for Saskatoon Cheesecake.

We love this place! Looking forward to coming back.  Pretty standard gastro pub fair. Nothing to complain about but also nothing that wowed us. Prices were reasonable as was the portion size. The venue had a good atmosphere  The food was great, the in house brew selections were great, the service was great... I totally recommend.  Service was friendly and the restaurant looks great, however we found it took a long time to get our drinks and our food was bland.  Great new place and we will definitely be back!
Service and food were great!  It was OK, but I don't know if I would be rushing back. We ordered several appetizers as our meal, and overall, they were fairly disappointing. The bread knots were hard and dry - I'm guessing they were overheated before being served. The nachos came without the beef we had ordered. Our server then brought us a bowl of (lukewarm) beef from the kitchen and said that the kitchen had sent this out because they forgot to put it on our nachos - no offer to even take the nachos back to the kitchen for them to put the beef on and reheat them. I ordered guacamole with the nachos - price on the menu was $3.95, but we were charged $5.95. A small Nacho ended up being over $30, which was not worth the price at all, especially considering we were overcharged and they weren't served as ordered. The Calamari was the best of the 3 items we ordered.

The Margs were on point, I'll give them that.

Overall, really disappointing. Read more Went to sit on the patio and the rooftop wasn’t open. Got sat on street level patio, super shady and so many wasps. The service was extremely slow.

The view overlooking the city was lovely and the atmosphere was one of quiet elegance. Our waiter Colin was charming and attentive, without being intrusive. We enjoyed the 3 course dinner special, which consisted of duck breast carpaccio with an arugula salad and raspberry vinaigrette, slow roasted beef brisket with mashed potatoes and vegetables, finished off with a pear tart. Wine pairings for each course were available, however we opted for cocktails instead. It’s nice to enjoy a dinner I likely wouldn’t prepare myself. Price point was reasonable for a nice restaurant with well trained staff and delicious food. Not recommended for families with small children. Read more Our family had an amazing time. Food was excellent. Our waiter Dean, was friendly, fast and accommodating. Highly recommend!  The bread pudding has cinnamon in it. A true bread pudding does not. Many of the desserts were so sweet. As a diabetic I could not eat any of them. They do not look after diabetics.  Chris was the best, great Neal and evening, brilliant views of the city in fall colours then evening lights.  We went to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was an overall excellent experience. Amazing staff, great food and potions, fancy.  I got the 3 course dinner, and it was phenomenal. My wife is vegan, and there wasn't anything on the menu for her. The staff whipped up an appetizer, Entree, and dessert special for her no problem. The entire experience was beautiful, and we have nothing but good things to say!  I liked the rotating sensation, but because the room was rotating, it was hard to find the exit and the bathroom. The time of day I went was truly marvellous. The setting sun on the horizon, as my table slowly moved towards the window facing the sun, created a unique experience, keeping the scenery fresh every time I looked out. The food arrived within ten minutes, which was a pleasant surprise compared to other establishments I’ve visited in the past. The food was excellent, and the lamb I ordered was delicious.

Great experience every time we go both food and atmosphere  Our group really enjoyed the entire experience.  The food was great, the service was amazing, the view was just as amazing.  Our dinner was a work team dinner, so when I am in Edmonton again with my family we will for sure be back.  Unusually poor! As repeat customers who LIVE dining at La Ronde, and have entertained three generations of family on important occasions in their fine dining room, we were VERY disappointed last Sunday evening. We had two elderly guests we wanted to show fine dining, exceptional service while viewing our bright Alberta skies and then watch a fantastic sunset as we slowly turned around the city. We knew the food well and were sure it would impress!
The skies turned rainy and a grey and there was no sunset visible and it turned out we couldn’t rely on the food either.
As the only one who ordered an appetizer I received a ‘job’ instead. I ordered the Caesar Salad with a house-made dressing. Out came a sleeve of Romaine leaves cut down the centre with the top layer of each smeared with their dressing and a fork and knife for me to ‘assemble’ it! I’m NOT a fan of the ‘deconstructed phase’ that a lot of chefs have adopted, and this provided me both work and a lot of lettuce without any dressing. I had about four butchered bites and the the dressing was finished.
If the four proteins we ordered for our main course, three were inedible. The lamb fell off the bone beautifully and was thoroughly enjoyed however the Pepper Steak, Steak Diane and the Prime Rib were all overdone and/or unchewable. Two of us removed a piece from our mouths after trying to get them down.
I can’t tell you how unlikely it was to experience this level of dining in this restaurant - we’ve literally come here for three decades!!
The redeeming factor was our lovely waitress (Laura?) who was beside herself with what to do, apologized profusely and we were sure to assure her it was beyond her control. Her manner, service, warmth and welcome to our guests, were great!
The bill was SUBSTANTIALLY reduced, as it should have been, and we appreciated that very much. However these guests are in their 90’s and from out of province, and unfortunately unlikely to get to experience the dining room of which we spoke.

So 8 adults not one of them was even attempting to correct any children . Overall it was not the romantic evening we had planned. We left our kids at home for a reason. I was very disappointed that a manager didn't address the large group as they were finished eating and ask then to move on or at least keep there kids at the table. I would never allow my children to act like that in public. It really took away from our overall experience.  The food was good although I felt a bit over priced for the amount you got to eat.

There did not seem to be an appropriate time for questions so we ended up ordering the 3 Course Seafood Family dinner as the choice of 3 appetizers, lobster risotto with 2 types of fish, and 3 mini desserts were chosen for us. We also added an octopus starter.  The food was spectacular! We especially enjoyed the Piri Piri prawns, the octopus, the halibut, and the risotto. It was ALL so delicious and was exactly the right choice as we got to try so many different plates which is my favorite way to dine, especially if it’s a new restaurant for me. Our Server was attentive and became more engaging as the evening proceeded, which we appreciated. The service was excellent and we never wanted for anything. I’ve had caipirinha cocktails before and very much enjoyed them but the ones I tried tonight (original and another with warm fall notes) were a bit disappointing compared to how great everything else was. Overall I would highly recommend adding Sabor to your ‘must try’ list, especially for a special occasion, and be sure to request the Boardroom! Read more Fantastic food and service.  This is our go to restaurant in Edmonton.  Have never been disappointed.
They have changed the recipe of the Octopus and it is even better than it was before, which was fantastic before.  It was a packed house prior to the first Oiler hockey game.

Always an experience; great food, great atmosphere, great service and a great experience!  Waiter was slow to attend to us.
Forgot parts of order.
Meals were just ok except the bruschetta that was unreal!  Very good service and food was great.  The short rib was amazing! Unfortunately we were seated by a large group who were rowdy and yelling so it was hard to have a conversation.  The pasta came out dry and cold. The short rib waa over smoked. And also came out cold. The potao and veg. Cold. We didn't eat. Left and went to another restaurant not in the hotel.  Overall, the experience was really good with the quality of service and food as expected. The only negative was by the time we sat for dinner at 7 pm about 1/3 of the menu was sold out so I may not recommend coming on an evening with a Roger place event.  While the food was excellent I need to say that Braven had the best service I've had ever, this can't be understated in today's climate.
What a wonderful evening.
Thank you Read more It is fine. The food is just okay, especially for the price.  We chose this restaurant because it was in the hotel. The menu had good selections and the quality of the meats was excellent. There is a glass refrigerator where you can view the cuts of beef and whole salmon. Our server was great. He was prompt,  courteous, and very personable. The appetizers and entrees were cooked correctly and very tasty. The only thing I would mention is it is quite pricey. For 4 people the bill was almost $600, and my wife and I shared a steak. I would recommend and will return if staying in the hotel again.

Where things went sideways: took over 20 minutes for arrival of first drink. Claustrophobic friend was denied ability to use stairs so couldn’t come up and join us. This started with concierge at hotel saying the hotel didn’t even have stairs to eventually the stairs being armed. Once we were told the stairs could be accessible, over 35-40 minutes had passed and they had already left. Food wise, for what we paid, it was incredibly underwhelming and bland.

 Meal- for $300… very poor. Steak was fatty- no flavor and for a 10oz.. was not the correct portion at all.  I had the pleasure of taking my friend to high tea at the Fairmont Hotel's Harvest Room this afternoon, and I can't express enough how wonderful the experience was. Knowing that my friend was going through a rough patch, I reached out to the team ahead of time to let them know it was her first high tea, and they truly went above and beyond to make it special.

The highlight of our visit was the incredible dessert crafted by their talented sous chef. They surprised us with a deliciously chocolaty twist on a Paris Brest, which was not only exquisite in flavor but also a thoughtful gesture that made my friend's day.

Loved the food and the view. Great service. A nice hotel.  I really do hate to complain, but our experience needs to be heard:

I was there for lunch yesterday and both Michelle and our drinks/meal were impeccable.

Today, it took ten minutes for someone to show up at the “Please wait to be seated” sign to acknowledge us. Even though we had a reservation, it seemed like we were putting the person who showed us to our seats out (there was no warm greeting or welcome), rather just a sigh and a shrug.

We were essentially ignored for the entire time (our waitstaff came to our table only three times, once to take our order, the second to bring our drinks, and once after we flagged him down to ask for the bill (because we were not going to wait any further to ask about dessert — even though we were celebrating a birthday, no sweets were apparently going to complement our meal).

Our drinks tasted like cough syrup and the arugula that accompanied my tuna was wilted and clearly past due. The grain salad upon which it was served was tasteless.

Sorry to say it was very disappointing. Took a long time for host to arrive for seating even though restaurant/balcony only had a few people. They did accommodate moving tables out of the sun. Host was  impersonal and not engaged or welcoming. Fabric seating was stained.  Salads and chicken wings just ok. We expect much better from The Mac.

I hope the restaurant takes my feedback constructively and makes necessary changes to ensure that guests have a wonderful dining experience in the future.

Desserts were also amazing and the cocktails were very good! Highly recommend parking underground was easy to access!  Sadly I can’t recommend this place aside from drinks and appetizers, although after everything that went wrong, the manager was very kind and did what he could to correct and comp things. We sat in the bar area and ordered, when our appetizer came (the mussels with red sauce, which were AMAZING) someone from the kitchen left it on our table but our server never gave us plates or cutlery or water (just drinks). Couldn’t find her so I grabbed cutlery from the table next to us and conveniently found a stack of plates nearby so I grabbed those as well. She did check on us eventually and took our main course orders. We ordered pizzas, mine was fine, but my boyfriend’s was a soggy mess and falling apart. We sent it back and when the server took the plate there was gum stuck to the bottom of the plate. The second pizza came and was exactly the same, soggy, but thankfully no gum on the bottom of that plate. Hopefully after such a disaster this place can make some moves to improve the service and food quality especially considering the more upscale environment (and prices) do not match up.

Recently featured in Edmonton’s downtown dining week.,"3 stars based on the fact we had a table close to the washrooms….like really close. Too close. Disturbingly close and that was all you could smell. Asked to move tables (had a reservation) was denied that request because it’s “full”.  When leaving there were lots of places away from the washrooms 2 people could have been sat. 
Table was also possibly the single wobbliest, lopsided table I have ever sat at.  Combine that with a terrible table design where you continually smash your knees into the stupidly huge solid base.  Seriously who picked these friggin tables?!?

Love the live jazz. We’ll be back! ❤️  For the noise level and ambiance, The Common should be labelled as a pub and not a restaurant.  Food was good.  Went for lunch, they have a more limited menu for lunch. We had the chicken sandwich and the chicken bowl. Both were excellent. Our food came out REALLY fast which does lead me to think they have most of their food ready to go. Great for a quick lunch.  Nice decor, nice energy. Food was great for the most part- the cucumber pieces in the cucumber salad were far too large for a human mouth, would’ve been nice if they were bite sized. Otherwise it was delicious. Drinks were meh, have never seen an old fashioned with so much ice which obviously made it taste very watered down. Overall though, it was a really nice experience and not too pricey. Read more Food and drinks were very good. Service also. 
I questioned the final bill as menu stated $10 for 6 oz glass of wine. Bill said $11. Server said it’s an old menu.  Maybe someone should change the price then. He did adjust to menu pricing.  Thanks for doing that. 
Overall The Common is very good. Read more Excellent atmosphere, staff and food.  Recommend The Common to anyone & everyone.  It's a must go...you won't be disappointed.  There was a live music event going on so my husband and I got up to enjoy the band, when we came back to our table we were told it was reserved so we could not sit there. I then told them that I had made a reservation and that we had already been sitting there. The staff then went on to explain the “duration policy” for reservations, even though we had only been there about 20 minutes. The staff then went to check their system and came back to apologize as someone had “removed” our reservation from the table and replaced it with another reservation placed at that table.

The drinks were good, but we didn’t bother to order food as we went for the live music and it was quite a short set. Overall the quality of the sound system was quite disappointing. I would not recommend this venue for any live music event as it is not set up for it at all. Read more Took a long time to be served. Two items we ordered were prepared incorrectly.

We had the mushroom pizza and french onion soup. The pizza was fine but the soup was terrible. It had very little flavour and the texture was awful. It was like they put bag cheese over a cup of breadcrumbs. The conventient location is the only reason to dine here.  Thanks! It was a great experience - my colleague and I felt the server was kind and friendly  My boyfriend and I dined here before a concert. We were expecting food and service comparable to Braven (one of our faves), but the restaurants definitely have different vibes. The food recipes themselves had potential; that said, my shrimp in my shrimp linguine were over cooked, and my boyfriend’s chicken parm was undercooked. I also added truffle to my meal for $6.00, and there was no sign of any truffle (neither truffle oil, nor any flakes etc.). Our appy (steak skewers) and dessert (tiramisu cannoli) were spot on. It did seem like our entrees were a bit underwhelming though.

One thing that seemed apparent was that all of the staff seemed very new. As someone who has worked in the service industry for more than 10 years, it seemed like most of the staff were still becoming comfortable with their positions. Maybe the restaurant recently hired for various positions, which I know can be common in the fall. Between the hosts, food runners etc., I think the team as a whole needs some time and practice familiarizing with guest interactions.

The atmosphere was quiet and beautifully decorated. Our server was kind and attentive, and overall did a great job. I would try Kindred again in the future - bearing in mind that it is a much more casual dinning experience than Braven, its more elevated counterpart.

The food and drinks were amazing too!  Made a reservation, got seated quickly. This was prior to Game 6 of the western conference playoffs, so it was busy. Food was fine, but service was unacceptably slow. It took a long time for a server to take our drink and food order (placed both at the same time)...then we waited. Our food came out before our drinks. We ordered a couple appetizers, but had to ask for plates.  We were going to order more, but no one came by at all to check on us.

Lovely spot.  Such an amazing experience! The staff is incredible and the food is amazing!! Highly recommend  I would not recommend the Chef’s Experience. It felt like we were served items that weren’t selling, rather than a thoughtfully curated menu. Out of the five dishes we were served, only one was enjoyable, which is disappointing for a $200 meal for two (including a bottle of wine). When we requested to replace one dish, we were met with an unhelpful response, essentially being told, 'you get what you get.'

I am not sure that I have ever had quite as much garlic/garlic options in one meal:  the use of garlic was varied; the dishes interesting; and the service, very good. Great to watch staff prepare the food from our high top. Not sure when I can make a public appearance without overpowering them with my garlic breath - but that's a first world problem!  Enjoyed!

Thanks for a nice evening out.  The service was outstanding, and I really enjoyed most of the food, especially the delicious pasta. However, the fried chicken was severely undercooked, to the point where it was raw and bloody when I tried to eat it. This made me feel unwell and unable to eat anything else.  Everything was great except for my wife got glutenated.
Food, drinks and the service was great.
We celebrated my wife’s bday there and on the reservation I notified the restaurant about the dietary restrictions. They also acknowledged the dietary restrictions when we ordered food. However I noticed the waiter did not write the orders down.
A dish was missed, later we inquired about the missing dish! Dish came but gluten was not removed resulting in my wife getting sick.
I strongly recommend that they list the ingredients on the menu so clients know what’s on each dish. Also highly recommend orders to be written down on a piece of paper. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/56644217.webp

We sat at the bar with water all over it and asked for a napkins to wipe it up. The bartender did not seem to be concerned and wipe it for us. The bartender did not engage us at all, did not ask if our meals came out OK, left our plated sitting there for a very long time, spent more time chatting with the other staff and we did not feel like our patronage was appreciated. We always like sitting up at a bar because 99% of the time the conversations with the bartender are enjoyable. it takes a lot for me to leave a negative review, but this experience was just unacceptable.

The seafood appetizer for two: the Scallops were a bit dry, and the Crab Cakes(?) were dry with little flavour. The sauce that was on Mussels was flavourful but a bit salty.

Our second meal was the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio, Prime Rib dinner, Lamb Chops and Smoky Old Fashions-SUPERB!!!!  We had the three course meal and it was fantastic.  So much food we had to take the dessert home. Friendly, attentive staff but they did not hover. Highly recommend.  Excellent food with outstanding service. Staff/Food/Location were all great in the heart of ice district and a wonderful casino below.  We were going to a show at Rogers place so this was dinner before.

We did the three course meal offering.  Wife had the carpaccio to start and I had the shrimp cocktail.  We shared of course and both were very good.

For our mains my wife had the lobster and halibut risotto and I had a couple bites.  Was very good.

For my main I had the steak and was cooked very well.  I added the Oscar topping but i think if I were to do it again I would pass on that.

The third option for main was a bone in pork chop. We saw it go by to other tables and it looked decent.

Dessert was shared and was a chocolate and peanut butter type dish.  Very good.  Didn’t need two portions lol.

All in all a very nice experience with good service and great food.

Easy to recommend and will definitely go back if we’re downtown again. Read more Food was amazing and service was great, we did the 3 course meal and enjoyed it very much  The food was very off and not good. The risotto tasted liked microwaved riced. The calamari was cold and not fresh tasting and all. Bread and butter was cold.  Went with a friend to celebrate milestone birthdays. Nice ambience and the food was excellent. The fresh bread was a nice surprise but I question the offering of gorgonzola butter because the cheese was overpowering. It muted the complex flavours of the carpaccio that was well prepared and presented. The lobster & halibut risotto was delicious. The wine went well with the food and dessert was light. I would not normally spend $100 on dinner but it was good value for the money.

The service was a bit over the top. There were a lot of staff, with training/preparation for hockey season obviously in progress. Staff were nice but we were asked a few too many times about how every single part of our meal was. If I had been on a romantic date I might have been annoyed about halfway through.

Staff are very friendly but occupy quite a few roles each as they have a small crew which then reflects on timing of your dishes/drinks. Food was good but every dish came with the same bread and lots of it, no diversity in pairings with your chosen items. Price was on the higher end but not exactly getting enough bang for your buck. Overall would rate a 4 due to overpricing on small quantities and lack of options to have served with dishes. Too much bread. And that some dishes were lacking components themselves to enhance each plate. We will try here again once they get their feet off the ground a bit more. Read more The food was so delicious!

Our server was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations!  Corbin was awesome, I have been there twice and he is so knowledgable and friendly. Good food and wine. Perfect little spot :)  Service and atmosphere was great but the we waited over 45 minutes for a cheese board and prosciutto board. That was waaaay too long.  Great date night place. The wine and cocktail options were excellent and unique too.
We bought the wine tasting experience, all around it was good, only negative was we felt rushed. We wanted to come in, have a cocktail, then have the wine and charcuterie together. But the charcuterie came out just as we were starting our cocktails. On a rainy Tuesday night there were only a few tables filled so I don't think it was a matter of the restaurant needing to turn our seats over as quick as possible. 
Even with this, we would return again - only this time asking for a little more time between courses. Read more A little disappointed in the menu . Very generic for  the price .

We were almost late for a theatre show because of slow service.  nice atmosphere and our server was excellent.  the ‘lobster’ rolls were  filled with coleslaw with a dab of lobster mix on the top.  tasty but seemed a bit short on the lobster.  We decided to give this another place a try after a disastrous anniversary dinner the year before. The only reason we gave it a second go was they comp our anniversary dinne,r because of the quality of the meal and so we still have gift cards, that my sister had given me, to use. First time we went to the Sherwood Park location. This time we tried Whyte.........and sorry to say our dinner was again pretty bad.
We had reservations for 6pm. When we got there it wasn't that busy at all and remained pretty quiet throughout our 2 hour stay. We were seated quickly and was told our waitress would be over to get drink orders. It took her 15 minutes to come over with menus and another 15 to come over to take drink orders. Another 15 minutes after putting down our menus as an indication we were ready to order she came to take out orders. Honestly the food here is subpar and very pricey. Again this place was not busy yet we could it was impossible to get refills on the drinks (which tasted very watered down with no alcohol in them whatsoever). 
Would not recommend any of there location. For seafood go to Red Lobster and for Donairs, your local corner donair shop will do better and charge less. Read more My wife & I ordered the Hot Lobster Artichoke Dip & Donair Egg Rolls for our appetizers. 
The dip was very delicous and had a lot of lobster and flavour. The Donair Egg Rolls were overcooked as they had been left in the deep fryer a couple  of minutes too long. In our opinion, they never should have been delivered to the table.
I ordered the Fish & Chips and my wife had the Summer Beets w/ garlic butter prawn skewer.  
Both main courses were very good and tasty. 
Service was spoty. Great when we arrived and then dropped off as the night wore on. Its the reason I gave 5 stars for the food and only 3 stars for the service. Read more Great Food and service.  Noise level was a bit loud.  Compliments to the waiters/waitresses!  Compliments to the chefs  There were 3 of us for an early lunch  - 1115 reservation -and our strategy paid off as parking was relatively easy considering  it is Whyte Ave.

As one of our tablemates was from out of town, we appreciated our server letting us catch up on our lives.   Also it was not very busy at that time of the day so that helped as well.

We all had different entrees - I has the fish with a side caesar, the beet salad was a hit with our friend and I can't remember what our 3rd friend had other than she was impressed with her side salad as well.

On the walls, black and white photographs celebrate the beauty of the local area.","This Thanksgiving, I had the pleasure of dining at Share restaurant in the Westin Edmonton, and I must say, it was an experience worth sharing. 

The prix fixe menu was delightful, featuring a Butternut Squash soup that was rich and velvety—an excellent start to the meal. The star of the show, however, was undoubtedly the turkey dinner. Juicy, flavourful turkey (white and dark meat) was accompanied by perfectly scalloped potatoes, tangy cranberries, and savoury stuffing. The fresh seasonal vegetables, including vibrant purple cauliflower, tender broccoli, sweet peppers, and crisp asparagus, added a wonderful touch of colour and crunch to the plate. And let's not forget the turkey gravy, which tied everything together beautifully.

Dessert was a highlight as well—a creamy pumpkin cheesecake that was both indulgent and light. I was pleasantly surprised not only by the generous portion sizes but especially by the quality of each dish. 

Equally impressive was our server, who brought an extra layer of joy to our experience. He was friendly, efficient, and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive.

Overall, my Thanksgiving meal at Share restaurant exceeded all expectations. Read more The restaurant is really more of a
Lobby extension  No quality check no option to order another cocktail  Unfortunately they were quite understaffed despite hundreds of us descending on the hotel. Must have been a worker shortage.  The staff did their best and were kind. We got our food and drinks eventually. Food was tasty.  Service was slow, we were in a room that felt like a board room and on our own, so seemed less attentive, food was bland and pricing was high for a meal that did fill us but felt like the quality was not there  Great Food. Waiter excellent and even had chef come out. Would highly recommend thisa place.  I have no idea what the restaurant was like because A) the reservation was not recognized by the restaurant and B) the restaurant was closed for the time that I booked.  I am no longer using OpenTable for reservations as I don't think restaurants use it or recognize it.  Or it's just a bad app.  We had a wonderful meal. Jude was our waiter and he was great. He was friendly, had a good sense of humour and was attentive to our table. The dining area was nice and we enjoyed our evening.  The service was exemplary. 
The reason I say this is because there was a mishap during our meal, which our server, Don, handled professionally and the restaurant took full responsibility for. 
We were very appreciative. 
The meal tastes delicious, and based on our experience, we will be back. Read more Coconut shrimp, foraged salad with salmon and warm lava cake was an incredible meal!

The food, service and overall atmosphere was divine.  Been to ALOT of Steak and fish restaurants and Atlas was very good  My wife and I had the $65, 3 course meal. It was good, my pork chop was dry. However, our overall experience was very good.  Our server was nice and made sure everything we needed was taken care of.  Our waiter was outstanding! So many great recommendations! The only reason I can’t give full 5 Star is your presentation of the wine list is GROSS! A wrinkled and stained piece of paper is not at all fitting of a premium steakhouse experience.

Great work by all the staff! Read more Went during a weekday, good experience and good family value.  The overall experience wasn't anything special. We waited a long time for out server and we often felt like she forgot about us. The food was ok but not exceptional. Our appies and food all came out at the same time. We watched a staff member drop a cloth on the floor (not realizing it) and another staff member picked it up and then wiped a table with it.  Amazing tasting food with great customer service. Food portions where small and a little over priced  Made a reservation, when we arrived our table wasn’t set up.  Got sat, no one came to the table for 10 mins.  Then a bartender came by and gave us menus and said our sever would still be a few minutes.  It was almost 20 mins after we were sat when she showed up.  Food took over 1/2 hour.  First two plates came out (we were a table of 6), then 3 more 10 mins after that.  Last meal showed up 15 mins after first was dropped off.  Chicken and Shrimp tacos were ice cold.  My daughter’s fries and hot dog were a joke.  Cold and old.  We didn’t say anything about he food because everything was taking so long we just wanted to eat.  Their excuse about the food delivery was that it was because one of our guests had an allergy.  Except the allergy meal came in the 2nd round of food delivered….
Manager came and apologized and gave us $10 wristbands.  Then I waited another 15-20 mins to get our bill.
Our server was Joy.  She was nice enough but the service was just so slow.  Kitchen seemed dysfunctional and the food was pretty bad.
We’ll come back to play games at Rec Room but we’ll eat somewhere else.

A tray of desserts I could buy from Walmart.  Unacceptable & you’ve permanently lost us as customers.  Would NEVER recommend this establishment  Steve was terrific while taking care of us during our visit!  He was professional and pleasant toward us, and we enjoyed his kind hospitality!
Thank you, Steve, for an enjoyable experience!  Excellent place for a business lunch.  Appreciate the environment.  Great food, our waiter was fabulous, no loud music.  Altogether a wonderful evening and dining experience.  We’ll be back!  The meals were top notch, lots of food and great quality, and the service was great!  It wasn't horrible....just not to the level I would expect from a steakhouse.
For the money I'd rather go to the keg....or even a Mr.Mikes.
I have had better steaks at pubs. My sons pasta was dry and half of my wifes prime rib was fat.
Without going into too much detail it was 2 star quality at 4+star prices.

Delivery to theater was prompt and as ordered.  Seriously the worst service anywhere. There is no management or leadership. You will wait 45 min for a drink and likely they will forget it anyway. Food is wrong and late. It’s like cineplex works extra hard to provide the worst experience. Ever  Very quiet. Great place to relax before a movie.  Great place for casual dinning.  The food was great and of good value. The live music was really nice however, it was too loud and it was hard to carry on a conversation and hear the server.  Nice evening out. Restaurant go busy quick and server had too many tables.  Tuesday night at 7 pm and we were the only two people in the lounge, so the service was great and the food was served promptly. Lack of choice of on tap craft beer, but that's understandable given what COVID-19 is doing to production and distribution. Still lots of choice of other drinks, and so all in all it was an enjoyable evening, especially since we had 2 for 1 tickets for the VIP theatre with lots of space between us and other movie goers. Read more I don't think I would bother to reserve a table at the theatre restaurant before a movie again after the experience I had here. Watching one staff member freak out at other staff members and having our drinks take forever was not worth what we paid. Just an uncomfortable experience where everyone seemed unhappy to be doing their job. 

We also had to ask for our popcorn and drinks in our theatre seats because the movie had already started and no one had delivered anything to us.  

Overal the VIP theatre experience is a unique treat, but I recommend going to a different restaurant and buying your own snacks prior to going into the theatre. They should stick to just showing movies because they don't know how to provide proper customer service to people when it comes to the foodservice industry. Read more My staff enjoyed the food, the entertainment and the movie!  We will be doing this again in the near future.  Four of us decided we would have dinner at the theater before watching the 730 show.
We arrived at 620 it was about 10 minutes before a wait person asked if we wanted drinks.
It was about 10 minutes to get water, at which time we decided we should order poor food to make sure it we could eat it in a reasonable environment before the 730 show.
About 755 they asked if we'd like to have our food bright to our theater seats as the kitchen was swamped, why did it take them this long to decide I don't know.
We went to our seats and about 10 minutes later they brought our food which required us to eat it very rapidly before the for started.

It isn’t just the meat that’s special – it’s also how we cook it. Our Montague broiler cooks at up to 1800 °F, giving a beautiful crust and flavour to every steak! We slow roast our prime rib in a humidity-controlled oven, keeping it mouth-watering and tender. And we put this level of care into each of our hand-crafted drinks, and from-scratch dishes, including plant-based and seafood options, with something for everyone to enjoy. All of this quality comes with friendly hospitality in warm and energetic rooms.

The servers were so kind and I regret not getting their names. We had a fantasic time and can't wait to be back!  Chop Steakhouse provided excellent service for our evening.  The service staff was excellent and accommodating. The steak with lobster tail for each of two people was awesome.  The mini crème brûlée for dessert ended up our dinner nicely.  We use to go to the Keg but Chop has better ambiance (not so dark), value (when you get  the prime rib, you get a piece of meat, not a sliver) and service, Michael was not in our face but there when we needed him to be. Would highly recommend!  We had a lovely time out for dinner with our friends. Our server was super perky and friendly with her recommendations.  Great food with great friends & excellent service from Mikayla - a great evening!  It was a pleasant experience, they usually ask if you are celebrating something, this time they did not. However the service was still excellent. Our smoked rib eye steaks were delicious, grilled the way we like it! Even the chosen veggies were tasty!  Steak was phenomenal! Was a little disappointed about the size of the lobstertail that came with my meal. 
Server was also a little off, wonder if it was his first day but he was super nice. 
Overall it was a great experience.  There was a noticeable difference in the portion size from the last time I was there. I understand food costs and inflation. I would be willing to pay a higher price to keep the original size portions.  I had a beef dip and really did not like it! It has the smallest amount of beef on it, it was a very sad sandwich.

See ya's all on steak night. We had 3 reservations but 3 joined us because a good time is always had at CBH!  We had a great time. The service was excellent and food was super fantastic. You must get the honey bumble cake.  OMG it is so good. I will definitely be going back.  This is my local Brewhouse so I frequent this location. I have never been seated in the ""games room"" before, so I selected the bar option on OpenTable as usual. I was seated in the games room for the first time anyways.

I was there to watch the hockey game so the lack of TVs in this area was disappointing. The few small TVs that were there had an odd yellow tinge to the screens. I tried to have an open mind because the restaurant will fully booked, however I would've thought my reservation made a few days in advance (as soon as the prior game ended, to be exact) would have gotten me a seat in the area I booked. The ambiance of this games room was only missing cigarette filled air for the vibe it gave. It felt like being in a back room of a restaurant in the 70s.

Service was alright at the beginning of my visit, despite having to ask for water 3 different times and my salad being forgotten and coming after my dinner. The waitress was around frequently. But by the second period of the hockey game our drinks were empty and the waitress didn't see anyone at my table waving for her attention 4 different times. That also meant she checked on the other 6 tables in the back area 4 times without coming by our table.

At some point in the visit an employee came by with a bucket of pucks that she smashed down on each table as if she was being timed, and without explanation of what they were. I enjoy a gimmick or fun extra game when watching sports, it just wouldve been helpful to know what it meant!
When our drinks sat empty for about 20 minutes to half an hour we decided to leave and watch the last period of the hockey game at home.

I think all these issues could have been rectified with more staff on a play offs game night, working on the games room to have the same vibe as the rest of the bar, and a bit of staff training. I expect a Canadian Brewhouse to be ready to host a hockey game. Read more Noise level high was a good thing. Let's go Oilers!! Team at Brewhouse took good care of us. Tons of fun!  Pizza was burnt and dry. Server was not very friendly or happy to be there. Usually a great place to go.  well...everything was very slow. Food was cold  when it arrived however the server and manager did a good job at recovery so extra points for making it right. Its too bad because potential is there to be excellent.

We pointed to a table in the far back and asked to be moved there and was told they couldn’t as it was reserved. For the 3 hours we were there no one sat in that area. When we asked the Manager to turn down the music, he told us it was set at that level and that it couldn’t be turned down.  Eventually it was turned down after mentioning it to our waitress. We wouldn’t be back because of the Manager and the loud music, which was great tunes. The waitress was amazing Read more We booked the tomahawk steak special.

Wonderful to have somewhere to go and relax knowing all precautions have been taken and they’re certified gluten free. The price is quite high though so we can only go on special occasions.  My group went there for lunch on Thanksgiving Day. There were not many other diners at the time - I imagine it would be much busier for dinner that day. The food was tasty and our server was delightful and attentive. A very nice experience.  Amazing service. We felt well attended to for brunch today.  The dish they are known for, the gluten free fried chicken, was soggy and bland. Chicken wings were undercooked while others were overcooked. Nachos were what you’d expect from a small town dive bar. We ordered dessert and couldn’t eat it. The frosting on the carrot cake tasted like they just smeared a block of cream cheese on it (no vanilla or sugar, just bitter cream cheese). The rhubarb crumble was ok but slimy.

So much hype for this place and it was empty at 6:30 on a Friday. 0 people in the dining room and about 5 tables in the piano bar.

We will never be back. Read more Best Sunday brunch in town. And compared to other brunch buffets the price is reasonable.  The staff are all so friendly and kind.  The buffet was delicious, and all gluten free, which you would never know unless told.  Even the deserts were gluten free and you'd never guess it.  They were delicious.  My only small complaint is the there was only fish and beef served.  The beef was a bit tough, and I'm not much of a fish eater.  Chicken would have been a nice alternative.  I would return.

Most of the customers were seniors, so the food was pretty bland and simple.

Staff. Attentive to refilling overpopulated buffet.

Here's what needs work.
Booking.  They overbooked. People were mad. Vocal heated discussions held near our table that we had to hear.  Ruined any hope of a nice evening.

Food lineup.  The buffet set up was on one side only so the line moves at a snails pace.

It is situated in a corner alcove near the entrance so people were crowded around the food mingling with people who were waiting to be seated and snaking through a labyrinth of tables already seated eating their food.

It was chaotic, classless,  pandemonium. A hillbilly hoedown would have had better seating / food line separation.

Overcooked / precooked food. Some dishes were literally mush.

Move the buffet station to the center of the room and make it double sided.  Put tables in the tight alcove.

My one step daughter couldn’t eat it, which we informed our server that she was celiac.. The rest of us did eat bread in front of her so I can see how that would be confusing. But generally we try not to eat treats in front of her unless there is something she can have as well.
I think it’s always just good practice to ask and then nothing goes to waste:)
Great service and great food and we will definitely be back. 10/10 Read more Excellent food and drinks. Even friends who don't normally like spicy food were happy with the meal.

Will come back for sure  Very tasty food we will be back. Nice gluten-free options.  The only small thing was one of the salads was listed as gluten-free but it cane with croutons this should also be gluten-free instead if removing it from the salads.  Service was outstanding. Food was ok, had the eggplant dip and saganaki as appetizers. The saganaki was made with halloumi rather than kefalotiri or another firm cheese. This made for a disappointing texture and flavor. For our entree, we share the chicken chorizo pae-sotto. The dish was wonderfully seasoned and delicious. One very minor issue with the dish was that we did encounter a number of bits of chicken gristle.

There were lots of guests but I didn’t find the area too noisy and we were able to hear each other well. We each had one of the handhelds. They were delicious and the bread was fresh. The fries and salad we chose as sides were equally as tasty. Our server was knowledgeable and gave good recommendations when asked about certain menu items. 
Closer to the end of our visit a large party came in and I guess there were not enough servers so ours didn’t come back for a while (25-30 min). We had planned to get dessert but because it appeared understaffed we decided to just get our bills. Our server was very polite and kind and was obviously working very hard so we were not upset with her at all. We will just have to try the dessert next time! Read more The food was good. The bar service was really slow. We had to remind our server a couple times that our drinks still had not come.  We got placed in a quiet both which was good.  First visit and we will be back . From the pizzas to the sandwiches all were delicious. The server was very attentive and was always available for a water or coffee refill. Spent two hours for lunch it limited my time in the market. Next time!  There were 7 of us and the food was great! Our server was pleasant and came back the right amount of times to check on things. Our server gave his recommendations for meals which was helpful! The food was hot and fresh. We will all be back.  First dining experience at Pyro - When we got there, we were seated, but waited quite a while before a waiter came to serve us.  The girl that seated us did not give us the Thanksgiving menu and did not even mention the option of ordering a Thanksgiving meal. We had to ask another server for the Thanksgiving menu/meal brochure to look at. The picture on the menu was really quite different than what we received in relation to quantity of food on our plate. We ordered the turkey special for Thanksgiving- for $30/person - I will note, that  the portion was very small.
It was tasty but both of us were still hungry when done the meal. I think the pumpkin pie should’ve honestly  been included in the price of the $30 meal! When I booked the reservation, it said the piece of  pie was $15 a person - which, I thought it was a little expensive for a piece of pie. When we ordered the meal, the server said they knocked the price down to $10 to give people a break. The pie was tasty though. When I got up to go to the washroom, there was another table of 6 people that had all ordered the thanksgiving turkey meal as well. Their portions on their plates were twice as big as what we received on ours. They had good more normal sized portions of everything on their plates - I believe like the meal should have been - way more of everything - where as our 2  plates of dinner had only a little scoop of stuffing, only a little scoop of vegetables, only two pieces of sliced turkey, and a small scoop of potatoes. There was definitely a difference in the other tables portions, which I was very disappointed when I saw what they received and what we had received. This was my first dialling experience at Pyro, and I’m not sure that I will go back to eat there. The ambiance was nice in the restaurant.   I was a bit disgruntled over the amount of food we got on our plates. Definitely something for management to address! Read more Great Thanksgiving meal. The turkey, stuffing, potatoes, gravy and vegetables were all delicious. At first it looked like the portions were on the small side but actually everything worked together and left at “just right” feeling. It’s a good thing as the pumpkin pie was to die for. It would have been nice if the waiter had of dropped by to ask if we wanted more water or to top up our wine glasses, however all in all we had a lovely evening. We’ll be back be back. Read more The Thanksgiving Turkey dinner was disappointing.  Vegetables under cooked and cold.  Only breast meat.  When we complained we were given pumpkin pie for compensation - but expected to share a dish between 2 people. No desire to return.  We attended the Thanksgiving dinner… The food was phenomenal… A great generous portion of turkey and stuffing and mashed potatoes with delicious vegetables. The price was amazing $29.99. Our server Amy was delightful. Everything just was so great for a family meal during a Thanksgiving celebration. PYRO did a really good job.

Great service and and overall excellent experience.  Great place for a group lunch. Tasty food and great vibe for business.  Great new Moxies with awesome food and service! Highly recommend!  Love this restaurant so clean and open, can be very loud at times, but service is always outstanding. Thanks Jamie for a nice evening.  Went for celebration of birthday and was not disappointed! Had the mushroom sirloin, lemon basil salmon, Caesar salad and churros ice cream sandwich. Birthday girl got a complimentary white brownie dessert (not full size). Everything was delicious! Love the interior, nice and open and bright! Will definitely be back!  We had a girls night with 5 ladies. Hailey was our waitress she was so attentive, great service and one of our gals are gluten free and she was so throughly in getting her order right! The food was excellent Lettuce wraps, burgers, wine and desert!
Your new place is so light & bright just lovely!
Only thing because it is so open the noise level went up as the evening went on.
But that is how the restaurant are now a days… we will be back!!

Tonight we dined with my brother and his wife who are vegetarians.
Buco had several choices for them   and our pizza was delicious. Our server was exceptional.  A go to place in St Albert . Gluten-free available for the best pizza in the area. Great service as well.  Great evening with friends! The server was friendly and engaging throughout the evening. The food was fabulous! Overall the experience was 10/10 and highly recommended.  Food is consistently good and service was excellent.   The high ceiling does result in a noisey ambiance however I did not find it difficult to talk , and be heard by my friend.  Fantastic service and exceptional food!  Will be back again and again!  A good experience overall. Always an enjoyable meal.  We loved my Family Birthday dinner, especially since we were seated in the booth and all 5 of us fit!  I realized afterwards we were not asked if we were celebrating a special occasion.  Otherwise it was a great first experience for most of us and we will be back!  Food was great!  The daily soup special was excellent, the salad and pizza perfect.  We had the Calabrese pizza. Was good except for the bottom crust was a little doughy. Great amount of topping. Waitress was great giving us time to figure out our order without being overbearing or no available. This was at noon on a Thursday and there was noise but not like a Friday.
Highly recommend Bucco!

The shrimp tacos and quesadillas were good.  The margarita average but service was excellent  When we arrived, the staff seemed unable to find our reservation. It wasn't packed so getting a table for four on the patio wasn't a problem. Our waitress was lovely but unfortunately, the service was slow. It took forever for our drinks to arrive. The salt and pepper chicken wings appetizer took a long time to come out. After we finished those, our mains didn't come out for a long time and when they did, they only brought two plates (we were a table of four) and the other two didn't come for 10 more minutes. The table-side guacamole was a great concept – it came in a cool bowl and tasted nice, but the person making it at our table had zero personality. It seemed like she was bored. The ambience was a little weird too. The decor is full-on trendy Mexican, but the background music was a mix of heavier rock. It would have been nice to have some Mexican artists featured instead. We had come to celebrate a birthday, which I noted on the reservation, but none of the staff acknowledged the occasion. Overall the food was delicious and tasted authentically Mexican, but the service was less than stellar. It seemed the staff couldn't time their food and drink delivery well, and the empty tables were not cleaned off in a timely fashion.

Service was very very good. 
Would definitely go back.  We went to the south location and we were seated in Drew’s section. He is amazing. Fun and funny, had good food and wine recommendations. We will definitely go back and ask for his section again.
Thanks Drew  Excellent food and excellent service  Great service, we had a reservation ( recommended) we were seated, acknowledged promptly. Our server Kiara ( hope I spelled that correctly?) was great. She was very polite, attentive. Very family oriented atmosphere. Not intimate but we were totally fine with that. The place was full!

Not impressed with this experience Read more Server was hungover and screwed everything up, broke multiple dishes beside us.  My husband my child and I am dined there Friday night. We had a reservation for 5:30 We showed up a few minutes early found our table and sat. Well our table was marked reserved there was still cups and spills on the table. We had to wait several minutes for someone to come and remove the cups then come back with a cloth that was far too wet and mop off the table. Service was a bit slow like usual but the food this time was less than great. I ordered the brisket shepherd's pie and was sorely disappointed. It was more potato than anything else on top of them using frozen peas and carrots there was very little flavor to the whole setup. My husband ordered the brisket grilled cheese and fries all of his food was heavily seasoned even the fries were spicy.

was quick to get our order and making sure everything was good  Went for lunch here mostly due to it being a nice day and their patio. Server was great, just the right level of attentiveness and helpful with menu. Of course, they have a great selection of beer on tap, including a low carb beer Michelob Ultra. At $5.99 a stein, this was good value and included Guinness too! 
However, lunch for 2 came to just under $100 with 1 beer each and an appetizer. I will not be coming back for a meal at that price as food was ok and standard fare. I would like to see a few more low carb items on menu (for diet-controlled diabetics)

A fair number of our party didn't get any service for 20 minutes once they sat down. She would take orders for a couple of people and then walk away.

Great service and would definitely do it again 👍 👏  We paid for a brewhouse bus to the Metallica concert both nights and it was horrible!! Not enough space people who paid couldnt get back on because it was full of people who werent on it to start with. They give you a voucher for 7.99 which we were told if we were coming back friday we could use it. NOPE you could not it was only good for after the bus left. We were not the only ones not happy as lots of us were from out of town just there for the concert. Sundays bus did not show up!! We had to find alternate transportation which was hard and expensive as hell. Never ever again !!!  Not only should we be refunded our 20.00 we should be reimbursed for the money we spend there as you have to book 1h before the bus so u spend money there first but also our alternate transportation. Who wants to bel late for a show that you paid over 700 for tickets.

UPDATE :SOMEONE REACHED OUT ONCE SAYING SORRY AND ASKED ME TO EMAIL THEM TO MAKE IT RIGHT AND THEY DID NOTHING!!! THEY DID NOT RESPOND TO MY EMAIL. Read more Purchased an advanced brewbus ticket to go to and from the Metallica concert. Ate supper there and the servers were great and managed to find us a table not being attacked by hornets. Bus arrived full and 25 or so people were left with no transportation standing in the hot sun. Eventually 1 Uber was ordered for 6 and the rest ordered their own with promise of reimbursement. We were told if we couldn't get on the bus back then to order an uner and be reimbursed but even if we did get on the bus it might not be going back to the same location. People left their cars there! And so much for the free drink tickets to use upon our return. Terrible experience. Poorly managed, never again. My advice? Do not use the Brewbus service if you want reliable transportation to and from a concert.
Update. Received a response from the manager to communicate via text as emails were not being delivered. They were very apologetic and the error was on the bus company's side. Thank you for the clarification. As I said the food and servers were great so while I won't use brewbus again, I will return for a meal. Read more Service was outstanding!

It was a great experience, the servers are friendly and very hospitable. The place is clean and the food are tasty. Keep up the good work!  Fun experience, but terrible service. Sat for 40 minutes without a drink or food order. After 20 minutes of sitting there waiting for a server, I went and talked to another server asking for service. After another 20 minutes she still hadn’t come by.  Major kitchen issues in VIP theatre - do not rely here to eat main meal. We made a reservation for 5 pm; movie was at 6:15 pm. Arrived and were seated promptly; not busy at all. Ordered drinks but they were out of lime so about one third of the drinks were not available. Ordered food - after waiting over 35 minutes, found out they were out of romaine and so no taco salad. Only found out because our server went to see why our food was taking so long. So ended up having to order a completely different meal 45 minutes after we first ordered which was concerning because first meals had still not arrived and now we weren’t sure if they were being prepared together. We had also ordered an appetizer but it took over 40 minutes to arrive and that was only after I asked where it was (appeared they were preparing it with main meals?). At 5:45, server said they would bring our food to our seats. We said we wanted to eat in restaurant before movie (that had been the whole point of the reservation to have a more substantial meal beforehand and then snacks in our seats). At 5:55, still no food and again they said would deliver to our seats. We asked to cancel our meals as we were ready to go into theatre. This was about 6:05. Drinks were also very slow (10-20 minutes each time). Got into theatre - there were plenty of servers around but it was clear the kitchen was struggling - food was not coming out and missing key ingredients for many items. No communication between kitchen and wait staff who were simply saying kitchen was backed up. Was NOT busy when we got there. We ended up leaving the VIP theatre to order our own movie food and drinks. Then the food still came to our seats after it was cancelled. We sent it back. Then duplicate drinks showed up. Our server Amy in the dining room was lovely, but it was abundantly clear that the person or people running the kitchen are not doing their job, don’t know how to stock a kitchen, communicate or prioritize orders. Read more Food was not good at all, it was also expensive.  Service was fast and waiter was polite.  Would rather go to a different restaurant in the future.  Great time and experience  Food was good. Service was only okay, but I do believe it was a fairly new employee so I understood that.  The drinks were great, it was  nice to enjoy dinner before a movie. Will most likely visit again for a date night.  It was a nice experience the food was not that great.  Unfortunately, the theatre experienced a power outage right after our dinner was served before the movie start time. The food we were able to eat before being evacuated was disappointing. We were expecting higher calibre pub grub but really got low quality pub grub.  The deep fried pickles were too battery and soggy, for example. We will try the theatre again but are only likely to order popcorn.

Raya served us again with exceptional  service. The food was great and hit the spot we where very satisfied  with the food (steak) we ordered which was very tender.  Thanks again Raya.  Food and service were good. Only issue was there was a ton of flies on our food and on us which made the experience a bit frustrating.  This was our second time at Chop. The first was lunch many years ago. The second was dinner very recently. We didn’t have a good dining experience the first time and thought things may have changed. Unfortunately, it didn’t.

I ordered the prime rib which definitely did not look and taste like prime rib. It was very dense and dry with no fatty parts that you get with prime rib. I have cooked prime rib several times and know the look and taste of prime rib. One person ordered the half ribs and while it was “fall off the bone soft”, the taste was not to his expectation. Another person ordered the burger. The ratio of pattie to bun was way out of proportion with the pattie being very small.

We tried one new item and it was delicious.     I’ll always return to this place.  A fairly quiet night inside Central. Food good but the fries are never hot.  3 of us and all the fries were barely warm.  Didn’t receive the warmest welcome when we got to the front desk. Someone came by and mumbled that someone else would help us out. Turns out that person was our server.
She wasn’t the most attentive and she was very clumsy. From clearing the table next to us and spilling water all over the floor to sloshing our beer all over the serving tray and handing us the glass that had already lost a quarter of its contents. 
Pizza was dry and the toppings of our BBQ chicken pizza were bitter and stringy. The half chicken we ordered was more like a split chicken thigh that was flattened on the plate.
At the end when we were packing up we had 3/4 of the pizza left yet she thought it was appropriate to just bring a couple small burger boxes. It took several times for her to come back 1 with more boxes and 2 without a bag for our leftovers before hastily grabbing at the money we left at the table before she disappeared completely.

I was disappointed with our nachos. Over half of our order was on stale, broken chips.  I expect better and have always received better than what we ordered that day.  I have been a regular for many years, and introduced friends to this neighborhood gem.
But…the wine list is awful, and as a result, we find ourselves avoiding OJs because of this.
It is not that difficult to write a good, focussed wine list. Please do so.  I had the fish and chips. A little too much batter on the fish and way to much fries and not enough gravy. Service was excellent. Music a bit too loud.  Regular customers…food is typical pub food…would be nice to see some regular menu changes, not just a couple summer specials.  Our server, Chanelle, was terrific.  We have enjoyed her previously and she’s outstanding.  We ordered your chicken tenders, they were dry and the fries, were not cooked properly.

Nicely decorated, with the fireplace video plating over the bar. Open and a bit noisy. Two salads, two pasta dishes and an 6 ounce glass of wine each ran us about $150.  Nice place but a bit pricey. Read more Very nice place for a nice dinner, the food was delicious, and the staff was awesome.  Food good, service great. We will come back! Natalia was terrific  excellent food, quiet easy to visit with my guests, did not feel rushed to leave.  Was awesome  Delicious gluten free pasta with a variety of seafood surpassed my expectation.

I informed her there was no way I was paying for food that hadn't even been served yet. Needless to say, our dining experience there was not great.  The Power Bowl was absolutely delicious! And the Sled Dog drinks were very tasty and refreshing. The 1/2 price drinks special for Canada Day was awesome. Great ambiance and amazing service!  Playoff game night noise was as to be expected.  Excellent service and food.  Booked a table for game 3 of the playoffs. Got a nice corner booth waiting with my name on the reservation and the waitress was an absolute saint. Took care of us the entire 2 hours we were there. Tons of different drink options (we had 24oz glasses of beer for $9.99) and the food is pretty good for bar food.  We dined at the bourbon street restaurant in west Edmonton mall and we ordered a bottle of Prosecco along with other food and the bottle does not taste right it actually appears to be flat so the waitress was nice enough to offer to change it and then another lady approached the table she did not introduce herself but I’m assuming she’s the manager but she was very rude when she approached us saying that the bottle was not an expensive bottle so the taste is normal and that she tried it and had a couple people try it as well and that it tasted normal to them.
Than she said it won’t do any good to open a new bottle because they’re all going to taste the same so to drink the one we had after she took it to the bar for a couple of them to try as per her words than told us to take the bottle we had back after it was tasted by them so she brought the same bottle back to the table and slammed the bucket down and left without a word, I feel very uncomfortable at this establishment after being treated like this it’s not like we’re not paying patrons so why be treated in this manner?
We actually love coming to Hudson’s for a family night out but after this encounter I’m unsure, I don’t know if this is normal procedure but I can tell you that it is very unprofessional and unpleasant for patrons to be treated this way.

Muy rica comida  Food and service was great . Unfortunately we had a big birthday celebration near us for lunch mid week and it was a bit noisy for us , otherwise a nice experience. I find it a bit dark inside and too hot to be outside so some kind of lighter ambiance would have been nice .  This is a great location. Our reserved table was far enough away from the crowd so we could converse without yelling. Food was tasty, our server did a great job for us  One person in our party had the crispy fried chicken which she found very tough to cut apart. 
I had the chicken nachos and my friend had ground beef nachos, both of which were sticky/hard to the point of not being easy to pull nachos apart.  There wasn't much chicken present.

Lobster was over cooked and then when we asked about cold butter being served the waitress didn’t do anything about it and said they served it warm. Will not be returning again.  Waitress had to be called to the table quite a few times when the drinks were empty after waiting a bit for her to return. Food was hot and came out quite fast which was nice.  It’s one of my favourite brew houses to go to. The manager is killer at what he does and how you get treated there  Family outing with kids. Basic pub food, served well.  The waitress was a bit rude and impatient, maybe this large of a table was not the best idea for her.  They missed served a pizza at our table to another table.  They just seemed disorganized and did not pay attention to detail  My favourite place. Hate to admit how much I go but its my comfort and my daughter loves it too. Oilers games and everyone’s a fam.  Service was extremely slow. I waited over 45 minutes for a drink.  The food and drinks came fast considering the were so busy with the oilers game. 
Great place to watch the game.  This is the first time we dined in Fort Saskatchewan at The Canadian Brewhouse on a Saturday.  Eileen's food (the Stirfry)  the carrots were huge (full size) The Broccolli was small with long stems.
We have eaten here about six times in the last year and never before had a complaint about anything, but we  always stopped in during the week.

This location was impersonal and uncomfortable at the tables. It felt more like a cafeteria which I don't like in a restaurant. I will never be back to have dinner at this place.  Good was good, they did everything that was asked as far as surprising the birthday girl. Just not sure why they would bring out the birthday cake before we had out food?😣  Great food. A little slow but busy. Not a problem. Ordered 3 Trio plate. Very good but shrimp were disappointing. Very small. Brother had steak. Very good. Cheesecake was fantastic. Always good place to eat  The food was spectacular! The service was one of the best. The waitresses were super attentive to us. The burgers were the best we have ever eaten!! We will return to this place!! We recommend it 100%  Disappointed tonight. Wife’s steak was over cooked, wait for meal was extra long and meals were lukewarm. TV volume was a bit high ( mind you the Oilers were about to play) Staff offered a free desert which was excellent. Needed to replace steak knifes. The ones that the chain supplies are more often dull and do NOT cut but chew the steak. Replacement knives, supplied by the local franchise were excellent.

Not a great night for our 54th wedding anniversary. Read more Great way to Celebrate Mother's Day. Food was great service terrific!  Service was terrible. Took a long time for wait staff to get to our table initially. Was never checked in with, never offered the opportunity to order more drinks after only having 1 round and bill was brought to our table as soon as dishes were cleared without being asked if we wanted anything further. The restaurant was not busy, we were just totally left without any service. We love Montana's but will not be going back to this location again!!! Read more Food was delicious and came out hot!

Everything was fantastic!  Service was great, wasn't waiting too long for the server to come by and check up on us.

The food was good but some steak combos had a bit more food than norma but was overall very good and tasty.  Small party of 3, we went for my son's birthday, it was our first time visiting.   We ordered a 12 oz ribeye with shrimp, BBQ platter and a butter chicken.    Meals were all quite good, fresh and hot.  I only rated a 4 star just because my husband and son said theirs was very, very good, not the best they have ever had.    Scales of one to five are more difficult than one to ten, I would have said 9 stars for a one to ten.    Service was fantastic, staff were very friendly and attentive.    It was a 5pm reservation, the restaurant was very clean, including the tables, seats and floors.   I also really like that there is a view into the kitchen through a window, that tells me that they are confident in the kitchen staff.    Overall we were very pleased, we will go back for sure. Read more Very good food, plenty no doubt,  just my steak was a little burnt,  other than very goo food and our waitress  was amazing,  I apologize I forgot her  name.  Always love the food. Service is always excellent. It can be a bit noisy but wasn’t too bad this time.  Service was second to none but food very average for what we paid. That being said, it’s close and convenient  Where is very happy with our waitress and or Service and our meal thank you  food is great waitress was great.the whole experience was enjoyable.  I ordered the grilled chicken with a side of Seafood Oscar sauce. The chicken was blackened and very dry, the sauce was the worst Oscar sauce I have ever eaten. The side of rice was plain and sticky. Not sure if I'll return, will definitely not order this again.
Service started ok but as it got busier our waitress all but disappeared. No one ask me if there was a problem with my meal when I left it pretty much untouched.

Good food, great service, good value. Read more Great food and service.  Will return again.  The atmosphere was great for visiting with friends while we ate.  What a great environment! The steak is the best Camrose has to offer. 
The service was superb!  7 oz sirloin 4 oz of gristle ,  requested a real steak knife that wouldn’t even cut it , the carrots were excellent , if you are going to call your self a steakhouse pay more attention to the cuts you prepare for the price.  Always have a great experience at Mr. Mikes in Camrose.  Visiting from the States I was excited to have some Alberta beef.
I ordered the sirloin medium rare, with the lobster Mac.
The steak came out well done, the waitress was very apologetic and had the kitchen re-fire my steak.
By the time the new one made it to the table, my sides were basically finished.
The steak although it was medium rare, had absolutely zero flavor. None, no salt, no butter, garlic, nothing.
The lobster mac should definitely be called mac, there's zero lobster. No lobster dust, essence of lobster or anything related to the lobster family.
Our waitress was wonderful but we won't be back to dine.
Huge disappointment. 
And no I did not complain while there, it's not my job to tell the kitchen they're doing an awful job trying to cook steaks. A waste of a good cut of meat.

Amazing experience!!!!  My lady loved and I love her. Just wish we didn’t have to scream as across the table at each other to talk  This was my second time going to Dolly's and it is always fun! The staff are friendly and accommodating and the decor is a VIBE. I went as part of a birthday group for Sunday brunch. The service was timed well, which was nice for a group of 7. A few people in our group were a little disappointed that there is no actual hot coffee beverages available. We enjoyed the cocktails we ordered, but it would have been nice to start off with a brewed coffee, cappuccino or something. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food for the most part. My partner's eggs were overcooked and I will say the tater tots that came with the eggs benny were pretty bland. They needed some sort of sauce or seasoning on them. I also found that the smashed plantain was way overcooked, I couldn't cut it with my knife. All in all it was a good time. I do think the evening food menu is better then the brunch menu.

The guaranteed one hour pre-theatre menu was tasty but not served in an hour. 😕  Lovely meal and service. Took my granddaughter for her birthday and she was treated very well. I will definitely go back. Amazing that it is totally gluten free which is unusual. Special treat for someone who requires this.  Food was fantastic. Had the Hungarian goulash and the beef was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. Great food, great service and great atmosphere  Lovely evening celebrating a special birthday. Keesha is an anazing server! The band was a tad loud but very enjoyable. Perfect evening.  Had a lovely time. We had to have the pickle soup and then shared several appies. Excellent flavour and presentation and great service.  The food and service were perfect.  AND everything was gluten free!  As a celiac that is wonderful.  The food we had was great which is amazing for a gluten free restaurant.
There was some live violin music they placed us right beside. It was quite loud which we weren't really expecting.
The gluten free bread was the best we have ever had.  We found out they make them in house and can be purchased.
The multi grain is worth every penny! Read more The service was very slow… we had been seated for 45 mins with no drinks from the bar coming out. At last two of the three drinks we ordered came so one of us still had to exit another 10 mins for our drink.  The food was good but we felt after having dined at the other locations many many times over the years that this location isn’t as tasty  This is the third time I have eaten at this restaurant and my guests and I have enjoyed it each time. The menu is European-inspired, with a range of tasty options. The schnitzel is my go to.

They also make several excellent, hearty soups. I have tried three so far and all three were delicious.

The Black Forest cake is tasty. Portion is large enough that two could share.

This restaurant also was a venue for live music during the annual Jazz Festival this summer and worth a visit if they continue to host jazz next summer.

Service was excellent. Read more Outstanding place to celebrate a special occasion with a large group. We had a wonderful secluded space all to ourselves for ease of socializing and yet could take part in the awesome live music if we wanted. The food was superb- the spinach and feta perogies were my top lick along with the mushroom spatzel while others raved about the dill pickle soup, roulad, salmon and the schnitzel. The Gluten Free menu is a real treat at Continental Treat, highly recommend. The convenient Jasper Avenue location was easy to access, and the ambiance at this location was really conducive to wanting to linger and chat and even get up and dance. Thank you!!
